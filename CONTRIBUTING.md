# Contribution Guidelines

Technically Speaking is Open Source, which means you can find everything on here and you can also submit issues with content!

We don't see a lot of submissions though, and we suspect it's because people either don't know that it's a thing they can do, or they have been self-censoring and not submitting because they thought the content is not "worthy".

## Why you should submit your own content
Yes, it is very difficult to sing your own praises, but that is precisely why you should do it - to practice. Get comfortable with highlighting your achievements. Your career will thank you.

## Why you should submit your friend's content
* It is often easier to praise somebody else
* Lift each other up

## What to submit

Not an exhaustive list, just some ideas:
* Talks you gave at meetups and conferences
* Speaking tips / Lessons learned
* Your speaking journey
* Conference report
* Conference organizing
* Travel tips
* Finances
* Podcasts / talks / videos

## What makes something worthy to submit
The fact that it exists. That's it. Don't think too hard about it.
