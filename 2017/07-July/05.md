# Edition 131

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Paris, France.

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running (and looking for sponsors for) [@360andev](http://twitter.com/360andev), July 13-14 in Denver, and teaching sketchnoting at [@WriteSpeakCode](https://twitter.com/WriteSpeakCode), August 23-26 in Portland. Cate is co-hosting [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) September 5th and 6th in NYC!

## Link Roundup

A common occurance, especially when it comes to addressing speaker homogenity, is to create "lists" - usually of women. Cate wrote about why this is ineffective [[read it](https://medium.com/@catehstn/lists-of-women-dont-change-anything-f412f70d4b40)][tweet it].

[@codeJENNerator](http://twitter.com/codeJENNerator) shares the story of a token woman speaking request - and why she ended up pulling out [[read it](https://jennstrater.blogspot.com.es/2017/06/no-it-wasnt-just-about-travel.html)][tweet it]. 

If you're presenting and using the console, don't forget to adjust your settings for readability. [@kencenerelli](http://twitter.com/kencenerelli) put together a how-to for Windows machines [[read it](https://kencenerelli.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/command-prompt-powershell-presentation-settings/)][tweet it].

Do you wait until the last moment to submit to CfPs? [@DamirSvrtan](http://twitter.com/DamirSvrtan) shares how that can work against you with decision fatigue and rolling submissions [[read it](https://2017.webcampzg.org/news/dont-send-proposals-last-moment/)][tweet it].
