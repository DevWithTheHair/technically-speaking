# Edition 131

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colorado and Paris, France.

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running (and looking for sponsors for) [@360andev](http://twitter.com/360andev), July 13-14 in Denver, and teaching sketchnoting at [@WriteSpeakCode](https://twitter.com/WriteSpeakCode), August 23-26 in Portland. Cate is co-hosting [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) September 5th and 6th in NYC!

## Link Roundup

A common occurrence, especially when it comes to addressing speaker omogeneity, is to create "lists" - usually of women. Cate wrote about why this is ineffective [[read it](https://medium.com/@catehstn/lists-of-women-dont-change-anything-f412f70d4b40)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Lists%20of%20Women%20Don't%20Change%20Anything%20by%20%40catehstn%20https%3A//medium.com/%40catehstn/lists-of-women-dont-change-anything-f412f70d4b40%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@codeJENNerator](http://twitter.com/codeJENNerator) shares the story of a token woman speaking request - and why she ended up pulling out [[read it](https://jennstrater.blogspot.com/2017/06/no-it-wasnt-just-about-travel.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=No%2C%20It%20wasn%27t%20just%20about%20the%20travel%20by%20%40codeJENNerator%20https%3A//jennstrater.blogspot.com/2017/06/no-it-wasnt-just-about-travel.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It disappoints us that these kind of stories are still so prevalent.

If you're presenting and using the console, don't forget to adjust your settings for readability. [@kencenerelli](http://twitter.com/kencenerelli) put together a how-to for Windows machines [[read it](https://kencenerelli.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/command-prompt-powershell-presentation-settings)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Command%20Prompt%20%26%20PowerShell%20Presentation%20Settings%20by%20%40kencenerelli%20https%3A//kencenerelli.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/command-prompt-powershell-presentation-settings%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Do you wait until the last moment to submit to CfPs? [@DamirSvrtan](http://twitter.com/DamirSvrtan) shares how that can work against you with decision fatigue and rolling submissions [[read it](https://2017.webcampzg.org/news/dont-send-proposals-last-moment)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Don%27t%20send%20proposals%20at%20the%20last%20moment%20-%20WebCamp%20Zagreb%20Conference%20by%20%40DamirSvrtan%20https%3A//2017.webcampzg.org/news/dont-send-proposals-last-moment%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@helenvholmes](http://twitter.com/helenvholmes) wrote up her process for preparing talks [[read it](https://helenvholmes.com/writing/preparing-talks-is-scary)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Preparing%20Talks%20is%20Scary%20by%20%40helenvholmes%20https%3A//helenvholmes.com/writing/preparing-talks-is-scary%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Or, "my own horrific way of coming up with 25 minutes of content that people then watch without seeing the week-long unwashed, unkempt, dungeon creature that is also me stooped in some weird corner at 3am in the morning the day before she flies out to give it." -- Yikes!
