## Link Roundup

[@lisaychuang](https://twitter.com/lisaychuang) gave her first talk after subscribing to Technically Speaking just 3 months ago. She talked about the [AMP project](https://www.ampproject.org/) at the Edinburgh Mobile Dev Meetup group.

[@amyngyn](https://twitter.com/amyngyn) shares [this excellent tip](https://twitter.com/amyngyn/status/867450772782366721) for setting up a friendlier audience.

If you hesitate before asking for feedback on your slides or a practice runthrough of your talk, consider framing it as whether you're asking for 30% or 90% feedback [[read it](https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Thirty%20Percent%20Feedback%20-%2042Floors%20Blog%20%7C%2042Floors%20https%3A//42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@ellenchisa](https://twitter.com/ellenchisa) had us from the very first line: "If you get hives every time someone says 'networking' this is for you." [[read it](https://medium.com/@ellenchisa/networking-for-introverts-926489e34d2)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Networking%20for%20Introverts%20by%20%40ellenchisa%20https%3A//medium.com/%40ellenchisa/networking-for-introverts-926489e34d2%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. KWu is very goal-oriented and thus loves tip #2 in particular to set a goal of just having one good conversation at an event.
