*From [@eryno](https://twitter.com/eryno): I spoke at the first Scotland PHP last year, and had a truly lovely time. The organizing team went above and beyond to make sure that I was comfortable and felt supported before and during the trip (which was very appreciated, since I was traveling from the U.S. and with surprise bronchitis!). The attendees and other speakers were great, too. I really encourage anyone speaking on PHP or other web-related subjects to submit to their CFP.*

## Link Roundup

[@TheAmyCode](https://twitter.com/TheAmyCode) explains why she creates technical content, how to overcome common roadblocks, and tips on distribution. Lots of it applies to giving tech talks [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gO7uldK7Ag)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Creating%20Technical%20Content%20by%20%40TheAmyCode%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gO7uldK7Ag%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) takes on the ways that women are - still - being silenced in 2017 [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2017/07/same-as-it-ever-was-we-dont-want-to.html)][tweet it]. It's not an uplifting read, but it is an important one.

[@femfreq](http://twitter.com/femfreq) also takes on the issue of silencing after being harassed at an event and calling it out [[read it](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/features/2017/6/27/15880582/anita-sarkeesian-garbage-human-vidcon-interview)][tweet it]. This quote really hit home "As women, we're always told not to engage, not to 'stoke the fire,' and that forces us into silence, it forces us to be quiet in the face of harassment. That silence helps perpetuate a culture in which harassment is permissible or even accepted as 'normal.' And so I think that for some women who understand what I’ve been through or who have been through it themselves, it was cathartic to see me not stay silent, to see me call him out directly like that, to acknowledge in front of all those people what he’s done."

## Inspiration

In this hilarious video, [@chethaase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) gives a terrible talk, dissects it, then offers some tips on how to make talks terrific instead. It's a great illustration that showing is often more powerful than telling
