*From [@eryno](https://twitter.com/eryno): I spoke at the first Scotland PHP last year, and had a truly lovely time. The organizing team went above and beyond to make sure that I was comfortable and felt supported before and during the trip (which was very appreciated, since I was traveling from the U.S. and with surprise bronchitis!). The attendees and other speakers were great, too. I really encourage anyone speaking on PHP or other web-related subjects to submit to their CFP.*
