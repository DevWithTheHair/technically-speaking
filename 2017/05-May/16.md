# Edition 125

This week we have getting told to be quiet, how to keep blogging when no-one is reading, and what are women's issues, anyway?

Thanks to this week's sponsor `who`

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Mountain View, California, where Chiu-Ki is attending Google I/O, and Berlin, where Cate has been speaking at [@uikonf](http://twitter.com/uikonf).

## Link Roundup

Cate put together a talk as part of Design+Exclusion. It’s about the ways in which women get told to be quiet, and some of the thought behind our approach to inclusivity with Technically Speaking [[watch it](https://x.design.blog/2017/05/04/the-not-so-secret-feminist-agenda/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Not%20So%20Secret%20Feminist%20Agenda%20%E2%80%93%20Design%20and%20Exclusion%20https%3A//x.design.blog/2017/05/04/the-not-so-secret-feminist-agenda/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This was a challenging talk to put together because part of it involved looking up some of the things people have said to her online that have not been so nice and talking about them. But it’s important to highlight the ways in which women are silenced – because it’s easy to ignore, and to surface the hard and continuous work that goes into creating space for under-indexed folk to speak up – because it’s easy to overlook.

Chiu-Ki wrote about why she runs 360AnDev - it's about creating an inclusive space for people to learn about Android [[read it](http://blog.sqisland.com/2017/05/why-i-run-conference.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20run%20a%20conference%3A%20To%20create%20an%20inclusive%20space%20for%20people%20to%20learn%20about%20Android%20http%3A//blog.sqisland.com/2017/05/why-i-run-conference.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

The Eloquent Woman is one of our favourite blogs on speaking because [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) consistently brings us new perspective. We *loved* this post on whether women should speak about woman's issues - and some thoughts from  Senator Kamala Harris about what women's issues *are* [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.nl/2017/05/should-women-speakers-include-or-avoid.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Should%20women%20speakers%20include--or%20avoid--topics%20about%20women%3F%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.nl/2017/05/should-women-speakers-include-or-avoid.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@geekgirlweb](http://twitter.com/geekgirlweb) wrote a helpful post on getting started public speaking [[read it](http://www.geekgirlweb.com/blog/2015/8/30/a-quick-guide-to-public-speaking)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20Quick%20Guide%20to%20Public%20Speaking%20by%20%40geekgirlweb%20http%3A//www.geekgirlweb.com/blog/2015/8/30/a-quick-guide-to-public-speaking%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Great tidbit, "I started by attending meetups, and where there were calls for speakers for Lightning Talks, or Panels that get organized, it's a less intimidating way to get started. Panels especially because you're answering questions with a group of people."

[@squeed](http://twitter.com/squeed) wrote about why it's important to have a zero tolerance policy for abusive people [[read it](https://medium.com/@squeed/jacob-appelbaums-may-9th-visit-to-stammtisch-2c0c4f372af0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Jacob%20Appelbaum%E2%80%99s%20May%209th%20Visit%20to%20Stammtisch%20by%20%40squeed%20https%3A//medium.com/%40squeed/jacob-appelbaums-may-9th-visit-to-stammtisch-2c0c4f372af0%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "Choosing to do nothing may feel like taking a position of neutrality, but it is just as concrete and active an action as, say, speaking out. If you don’t say anything against abusers, you are actively sending a message that you tolerate abuse."
