## Link Roundup

Cate put together a talk as part of Design+Exclusion. It’s about the ways in which women get told to be quiet, and some of the thought behind our approach to inclusivity with Technically Speaking [[watch it](https://x.design.blog/2017/05/04/the-not-so-secret-feminist-agenda/)][tweet it]. This was a challenging talk to put together because part of it involved looking up some of the things people have said to her online that have not been so nice and talking about them. But it’s important to highlight the ways in which women are silenced – because it’s easy to ignore, and to surface the hard and continuous work that goes into creating space for under-indexed folk to speak up – because it’s easy to overlook.
