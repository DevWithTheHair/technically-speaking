## Link Roundup

Cate wrote about her process for breaking talk prep down to make it manageable [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/05/25/preparing-a-talk-in-pieces/)][tweet it]. Preparing talks is a lot of work!

Incredible and throught provoking thread by [@Shakestweetz](http://twitter.com/Shakestweetz) about what it means to women to be "inspiring" and how that relates to Hilary Clinton [[read it](https://twitter.com/Shakestweetz/status/868526717069119492)].

Such a great story of getting started in public speaking from [@housecor](http://twitter.com/housecor) [[read it](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/public-speaking-transformed-my-life-and-can-change-yours-too-ca8acdbcc188)][tweet it]. "Communication forms the foundation of your life experience. I used public speaking as the means to conquer my illogical fears and break out of my shell. The odd fallout of speaking a lot: I‚Äôm now as comfortable speaking to a crowd of hundreds as I am having a beer 1:1." 

Handy tip for Mac OSX users [[read it](https://twitter.com/dorian_escplan/status/865677845246263296)] - you can disable all notifications when presenting!

## Inspiration

[@amyngyn](http://twitter.com/amyngyn) wrote about how she iterated and improved her talk to give it a second time [[read it](http://blog.amynguyen.net/?p=689)][tweet it]. "If I have more than 30 minutes of things to say about this topic, I‚Äôm now thinking I should prioritize content that is interesting and easy to process over content that is important but boring." is such a helpful takeaway! Also Amy, we really want you to know that we LOVE the triangle. LOVE IT. We are inspired by your triangle - and all the work you put into it. Thank you üìê
