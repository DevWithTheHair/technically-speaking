## Link Roundup

A list of lies that speakers tell ourselves from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/04/39-lies-myths-and-mistaken-notions.html)][tweet it] - we've definitely been guilty of a few of these. Have you?

[@zarahjutz](http://twitter.com/zarahjutz) breaks down what went into looking like a "natural" on stage [[read it](http://zdominguez.com/2017/04/17/all-it-takes-patience.html)][tweet it]. "Most of the time we see the result, but we rarely see the blood, sweat, and tears paid to bring about that result." -- an important thing to remember.

Reader [@rosieclarke](www.twitter.com/rosieclarke) sent us a twitter thread by [@Delafina777](http://twitter.com/Delafina777) on creating space for women to speak in meetings, and "the mom voice" [[read it](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/846600201108303872)][tweet it]. As Rosie pointed out, these strategies are partly helpful in the short term but also point to massive structural issues that have to be addressed long term.

[@FMuntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu) shares how she uses her intro to get to know her audience [[read it](https://medium.com/upday-devs/about-intros-nerves-and-discovering-yourself-2b839f4a361a)][tweet it].
