# Edition 123

This week we have one year on from a parity pledge, creating space for women to speak up, and some lies speakers tell ourselves.

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colorado and Lisbon!

## Link Roundup

A list of lies that speakers tell ourselves from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/04/39-lies-myths-and-mistaken-notions.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=39%20lies%2C%20myths%2C%20and%20mistaken%20notions%20speakers%20tell%20themselves%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/04/39-lies-myths-and-mistaken-notions.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] - we've definitely been guilty of a few of these. Have you?

[@zarahjutz](http://twitter.com/zarahjutz) breaks down what went into looking like a "natural" on stage [[read it](http://zdominguez.com/2017/04/17/all-it-takes-patience.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=All%20You%20Need%20is%20Just%20a%20Little%20Patience%20by%20%40zarahjutz%20http%3A//zdominguez.com/2017/04/17/all-it-takes-patience.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "Most of the time we see the result, but we rarely see the blood, sweat, and tears paid to bring about that result." -- an important thing to remember.

Reader [@rosieclarke](www.twitter.com/rosieclarke) sent us a twitter thread by [@Delafina777](http://twitter.com/Delafina777) on creating space for women to speak in meetings, and "the mom voice" [[read it](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/846600201108303872)]. As Rosie pointed out, these strategies are partly helpful in the short term but also point to massive structural issues that have to be addressed long term.

[@FMuntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu) shares how she uses her intro to get to know her audience [[read it](https://medium.com/upday-devs/about-intros-nerves-and-discovering-yourself-2b839f4a361a)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=About%20Intros%2C%20Nerves%20and%20Discovering%20Yourself%20by%20%40FMuntenescu%20https%3A//medium.com/upday-devs/about-intros-nerves-and-discovering-yourself-2b839f4a361a%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We appreciate this retrospective of how effective a parity pledge has been one year on by [@creafarrar](https://twitter.com/creafarrar) [[read it](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/09/the-gds-parity-pledge-one-year-on/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20%40gdsteam%20Parity%20Pledge%2C%20one%20year%20on%20%7C%20Government%20Digital%20Service%20by%20%40creafarrar%20https%3A//gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/09/the-gds-parity-pledge-one-year-on/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote on the effectiveness, "The figures show a definite improvement, and we believe that it’s largely a result of that public pledge. Having it online as a shareable post has made it easier for us to explain our diversity values to event organisers."

## Inspiration

When speakers want audience participation, the go-to trick is to ask people to raise their hands, which gets old pretty quickly. There are other ways you can engage the audience though. See how [@brwngrldev](https://twitter.com/brwngrldev) get people to talk to each other and then shout out their findings in her [@droidconbos](https://twitter.com/droidconbos) keynote (at 25:24) [[watch it](https://slideslive.com/38900598/first-do-no-harm)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=First,%20Do%20No%20Harm%20by%20%40brwngrldev%20https%3A//slideslive.com/38900598/first-do-no-harm%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
