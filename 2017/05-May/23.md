# Edition 126

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Amsterdam, and Mountain View, where Chiu-Ki has been attending Google IO!

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running (and looking for sponsors for) [@360andev](http://twitter.com/360andev), July 13-14 in Denver, and teaching sketchnoting at [@WriteSpeakCode](https://twitter.com/WriteSpeakCode), August 23-26 in Portland.

## Link Roundup

We're disappointed to see France rejecting visa's for WordCamp EU attendees based on the low ticket price [[read it](https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/19/a-letter-from-wordpress-community-to-emmanuel-macron-the-president-of-france/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20letter%20from%20%40WCEurope%20to%20Emmanuel%20Macron%2C%20the%20president%20of%20France%20https%3A//2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/19/a-letter-from-wordpress-community-to-emmanuel-macron-the-president-of-france/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We love that [@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) wrote a retro on five years of public speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@wiredferret/5-years-behind-the-mic-7ed8f2d25222)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=5%20years%20behind%20the%20mic%20by%20%40wiredferret%20https%3A//medium.com/%40wiredferret/5-years-behind-the-mic-7ed8f2d25222%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "I thought about what 5 things I would tell that speaker, besides sheâ€™s awesome for taking this leap." -- what a beautiful way to give advice, and capture some things learned.

If you're under-indexed in tech and work on mobile, Cate will do a call with you about anything you want (including your upcoming talk) [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/05/16/mentoring-calls-available/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Mentoring%20Calls%20Available%20by%20%40catehstn%20https%3A//cate.blog/2017/05/16/mentoring-calls-available%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

On point thread from [@kwuchu](http://twitter.com/kwuchu) about being asked to give cultural talks rather than technical ones [[read it](https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/860324331838197760)].

We love this post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) about Samantha Bee's comments on the effect of her outfit on her presenting style [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/05/samantha-bee-on-presenting-in.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Samantha%20Bee%20on%20presenting%20in%20a%20comfortable%20outfit%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/05/samantha-bee-on-presenting-in.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "I was having a terrible time because I was so physically uncomfortable."

## Inspiration

Google surprised the community by announcing official support for Kotlin for Android, surprised the attendees again by having non-Googlers give a talk on it, and, one more surprise, dedicates half of the presentation to talk beyond code. [@RunChristinaRun](https://twitter.com/RunChristinaRun) (starting at [19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPzxfeDJDzY&t=19m40s)) did a fabulous job covering how to convince your co-workers and management to adopt Kotlin, which is just as important as learning the language [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPzxfeDJDzY)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=At%20%23io17,%20%40RunChristinaRun%20goes%20beyond%20code%20to%20explain%20how%20to%20convince%20your%20org%20to%20adopt%20Kotlin%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPzxfeDJDzY%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
