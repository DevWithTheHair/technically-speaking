## Link Roundup

We're disappointed to see France rejecting visa's for WordCamp EU attendees based on the low ticket price [[read it](https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/19/a-letter-from-wordpress-community-to-emmanuel-macron-the-president-of-france/)][tweet it].

We love that [@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) wrote a retro on five years of public speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@wiredferret/5-years-behind-the-mic-7ed8f2d25222)][tweet it]. "I thought about what 5 things I would tell that speaker, besides sheâ€™s awesome for taking this leap." -- what a beautiful way to give advice, and capture some things learned.

If you're under-indexed in tech and work on mobile, Cate will do a call with you about anything you want (including your upcoming talk) [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/05/16/mentoring-calls-available/)][tweet it].

On point thread from [@kwuchu](http://twitter.com/kwuchu) about being asked to give cultural talks rather than technical ones [[read it](https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/860324331838197760)].

We love this post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) about Samantha Bee's comments on the effect of her outfit on her presenting style [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.pt/2017/05/samantha-bee-on-presenting-in.html)][tweet it]. "I was having a terrible time because I was so physically uncomfortable."
