[@hilarysK](https://twitter.com/hilarysk) talks about finding "developer happiness" through Write/Speak/Code conference. "In the Ruby community, we talk a lot about "developer happiness." As someone relatively new to tech (I've been full-time for only two years), I didn't know what developer happiness would look like to me, specifically. Thanks to last year's Write/Speak/Code, I have a much better idea."
