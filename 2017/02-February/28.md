## Link Roundup

We were really happy to sponsor the first Rails Girls Pelotas 2017 (Brazil) and loved this write up from organizer [@thaynaalmeng](http://twitter.com/thaynaalmeng) [[read it](https://gist.github.com/euthayna/228ede48306a894a257349e6c51913d7)][tweet it]!

If you worry about what to do with your hands when speaking, [@sabinanawaz](http://twitter.com/sabinanawaz) has you covered with three ideas [[read it](http://www.inc.com/sabina-nawaz/3-things-to-do-with-your-hands-when-you-speak.html)][tweet it].

Helpful notes by [@lucykbain](http://twitter.com/lucykbain) from a public speaking training she attended [[read it](http://lucybain.com/blog/2017/public-speaking-notes/)][tweet it]. We love the idea of creating a slogan for the talk - the key take away in five or six words.

Interesting results from a survey of 100 speakers from [@MarkDalgarno](http://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno) [[read it](https://medium.com/@markdalgarno/what-a-survey-of-100-conference-speakers-told-me-7fcc5eac7d3d#.at19rs6e2)][tweet it]. Most encouraging was the number of people who were confident it had improved their career in some way.

Cate talked about Technically Speaking and newsletters in general on the podcast "Should We" [[listen](http://www.shouldwe.co/season-02/give-advice)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

Helpful deconstruction from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on what made a scientfic TED MED talk one of the most popular of 2016 [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/what-made-this-one-of-teds-most-popular.html)][tweet it]. One thing to takeaway is the importance of clear language.
