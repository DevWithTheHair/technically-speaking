## Link Roundup

We were really happy to sponsor the first Rails Girls Pelotas 2017 (Brazil) and loved this write up from organizer [@thaynaalmeng](http://twitter.com/thaynaalmeng) [[read it](https://gist.github.com/euthayna/228ede48306a894a257349e6c51913d7)][tweet it]!

If you worry about what to do with your hands when speaking, [@sabinanawaz](http://twitter.com/sabinanawaz) has you covered with three ideas [[read it](http://www.inc.com/sabina-nawaz/3-things-to-do-with-your-hands-when-you-speak.html)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

Helpful deconstruction from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on what made a scientfic TED MED talk one of the most popular of 2016 [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/what-made-this-one-of-teds-most-popular.html)][tweet it]. One thing to takeaway is the importance of clear language.
