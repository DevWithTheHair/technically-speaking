## Link Roundup

For black history month, [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) put up a list of famous speeches by black women [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/for-blackhistorymonth-46-famous.html)][tweet it]. Have we told you how much we love Michelle Obama lately? She made the list five times. Queen Beyonc√©'s speech about fashion is also _amazing_.

We appreciate this write up from [@NatDudley](http://twitter.com/natdudley) on the handling of the CoC violation at Webstock last week [[read it](https://app.simplenote.com/publish/bKHZCC)][tweet it]. It breaks down how the incident was handled, and whether anything could have been done to prevent it.

Helpful post from [@CrystalMHuff](http://twitter.com/CrystalMHuff) on incusive forms of address [[read it](https://crystalhuff.com/2017/02/16/gender-inclusive-forms-of-address/)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

We're tearing up at this video of a song based on HRC's concession speach. To All the Little Girls. [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkS2Sl1klXQ)][tweet it].
