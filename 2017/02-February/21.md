# Edition 113

This week we have famous speeches by black women for Black History Month, inclusive forms of address, handling a CoC violation, and conferences offering payment in "exposure" (but only to some speakers!)

## Link Roundup

For black history month, [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) put up a list of famous speeches by black women [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/for-blackhistorymonth-46-famous.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=For%20%23BlackHistoryMonth%2C%2046%20famous%20speeches%20by%20black%20women%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/for-blackhistorymonth-46-famous.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Have we told you how much we love Michelle Obama lately? She made the list five times. Queen Beyonc√©'s speech about fashion is also _amazing_.

We appreciate this write up from [@NatDudley](http://twitter.com/natdudley) on the handling of the CoC violation at Webstock last week [[read it](https://app.simplenote.com/publish/bKHZCC)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%23%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation%20by%20%40NatDudley%20https%3A//app.simplenote.com/publish/bKHZCC%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It breaks down how the incident was handled, and whether anything could have been done to prevent it.

Helpful post from [@CrystalMHuff](http://twitter.com/CrystalMHuff) on inclusive forms of address [[read it](https://crystalhuff.com/2017/02/16/gender-inclusive-forms-of-address/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Gender%20Inclusive%20Forms%20of%20Address%20by%20%40CrystalMHuff%20https%3A//crystalhuff.com/2017/02/16/gender-inclusive-forms-of-address/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Great transparency report from CSSConf and JSConf Australia by [@fox](http://twitter.com/fox) [[read it](https://medium.com/@fox/cssconf-and-jsconf-australia-diversity-report-efd78de4ed6e#.nkm837vgc)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=CSSConf%20and%20JSConf%20Australia%20Diversity%20Report%20by%20%40fox%20https%3A//medium.com/%40fox/cssconf-and-jsconf-australia-diversity-report-efd78de4ed6e%23.nkm837vgc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Super true thread on being paid to speak by [@Luvvie](http://twitter.com/Luvvie) [[read it](https://storify.com/Luvvie/about-speaking-conferences-exposure-income-and-pay)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=About%20Speaking%20Conferences%2C%20Exposure%20Income%20and%20Pay%20Gap%20%28with%20tweets%29%20by%20%40Luvvie%20https%3A//storify.com/Luvvie/about-speaking-conferences-exposure-income-and-pay%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. So much side eye for the for profit events that pay men... and ask women (especially women of color) to do it for "exposure".

## Inspiration

We're tearing up at this video of a song based on HRC's concession speech. To All the Little Girls. [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkS2Sl1klXQ)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=To%20All%20The%20Little%20Girls%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXkS2Sl1klXQ%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
