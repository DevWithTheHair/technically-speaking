## Link Roundup

Should men have been speaking at the women's march? We're actually not going to take that question on. What we will say is that they should be particularly careful to respect the time guidelines. [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) points out how timing was clearly enforced more stringently for women speakers, and this caused many women - who we would, for the record, much perfer to hear from to get cut off [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/01/when-man-hogs-mic-at-the-womens-march.html)][tweet it]. We have to lol that he never got to finish giving everyone else a todo list because he wasn't organized with his own time.
