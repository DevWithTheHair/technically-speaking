# Edition 111

This week we have men speaking at the women's march, writing a successful proposal, and co-presenting!

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!

## Link Roundup

Should men have been speaking at the women's march? We're actually not going to take that question on. What we will say is that they should be particularly careful to respect the time guidelines. [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) points out how timing was clearly enforced more stringently for women speakers, and this caused many women - who we would, for the record, much perfer to hear from to get cut off [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/01/when-man-hogs-mic-at-the-womens-march.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=When%20a%20man%20hogs%20the%20mic%20at%20the%20the%20Women%27s%20March%20on%20Washington%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/01/when-man-hogs-mic-at-the-womens-march.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We have to lol that he never got to finish giving everyone else a todo list because he wasn't organized with his own time.

Great tips from [@fox](https://twitter.com/fox) on how to write a successful conference proposal. Hightlights: use inclusive language, ask a friend to proof-read, and yes, submit more than one proposal [[read it](https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32#.ejc9c7ryy)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20write%20a%20successful%20conference%20proposal%20by%20%40fox%20https%3A//medium.com/%40fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32%23.ejc9c7ryy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

Have a hard time convincing yourself that you are qualified to give a talk? [@ballingt](https://twitter.com/ballingt/) got a rapid fire list of reasons that yes, you are qualified [[read it](http://ballingt.com/wanna-do-a-talk)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Who%20am%20I%20to%20give%20this%20talk?%20by%20%40ballingt%20http%3A//ballingt.com/wanna-do-a-talk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Such a detailed and enthusiastic write up from [@brunoaybarg](http://twitter.com/brunoaybarg) about his experience attending DroidCon NYC [[read it](https://medium.com/@bruno.aybar/my-journey-to-droidcon-d1e0e78467dd)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20journey%20to%20Droidcon%20by%20%40brunoaybarg%20https%3A//medium.com/%40bruno.aybar/my-journey-to-droidcon-d1e0e78467dd%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@lara_hogan](http://twitter.com/lara_hogan) wrote about co-presenting as a strategy for feeling more comfortable public speaking [[read it](https://24ways.org/2016/public-speaking-with-a-buddy/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20Speaking%20with%20a%20Buddy%20by%20%40lara_hogan%20https%3A//24ways.org/2016/public-speaking-with-a-buddy/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. She also has this great piece of advice, "Co-presenting won’t work if you don’t trust the person you’re onstage with, or if you don’t have good chemistry working together. It might also not work if there’s an imbalance of responsibilities, both in preparing the talk and giving it."

## Inspiration

We love these blogging principles from [@b0rk](http://twitter.com/b0rk) [[read it](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/823183090554126336)]. We're inspired to write more - and hope you are too!
