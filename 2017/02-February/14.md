## Link Roundup

Follow-up post from [@davecheney](https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/830619728997593088) of [@GopherCon](https://twitter.com/GopherCon/status/825836695446659072) with insights on the why, not just the how, of writing a good conference proposal. Key quote: Show the reviewers you’ve thought about the audience, and you’ll make their decision a lot simpler [[read it](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/02/12/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20why,%20not%20just%20the%20how,%20of%20writing%20a%20good%20conference%20proposal%20by%20%40davecheney%0Ahttps%3A//dave.cheney.net/2017/02/12/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Great series by  [@mwichary](https://twitter.com/mwichary) on giving talks, with lots of advanced techniques such as projector-friendly color profile, skip slides, companion site and more [[read it](https://medium.com/the-rectangle-behind-you)][tweet it].

We loved the #shepersisted hashtag, and really appreciated this post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) with all the details of what happened in the senate and how it became a viral sensation [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/famous-speech-friday-elizabeth-warrens.html)][tweet it]. We love this quote from Warren herself,  "What hit me the hardest was, it is about silence. It’s about trying to shut people up. It’s about saying, ‘No, no, no, just go ahead and vote.’ This is going to be hard. We don’t have the tools. There’s going to be a lot that we will lose. But I guarantee, the one thing we will not lose, we will not lose our voices.”

[@nicoleckohler](http://twitter.com/nicoleckohler) overcame anxiety, depression, and chronic illness to start presenting at tech events. She shares four tips for moving past fears to start sharing your knowledge through public speaking [[watch it](http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/23/nicole-kohler-how-to-overcome-your-fears-and-start-sharing-your-knowledge/)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

A story from [@MsKellyMHayes](http://twitter.com/MsKellyMHayes) on rethinking her speech at the last moment contains some words that a lot of people need to hear right now, "They can tell you how to help, how to plug in, how to learn; because we all have a lot to learn, right? I have never showed up to help a cause and not had a lot to learn about that cause, even the issues that affect me. I often have a lot to learn."
