## Link Roundup

Follow-up post from [@davecheney](https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/830619728997593088) of [@GopherCon](https://twitter.com/GopherCon/status/825836695446659072) with insights on the why, not just the how, of writing a good conference proposal. Key quote: Show the reviewers you’ve thought about the audience, and you’ll make their decision a lot simpler [[read it](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/02/12/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20why,%20not%20just%20the%20how,%20of%20writing%20a%20good%20conference%20proposal%20by%20%40davecheney%0Ahttps%3A//dave.cheney.net/2017/02/12/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

A story from [@MsKellyMHayes](http://twitter.com/MsKellyMHayes) on rethinking her speech at the last moment contains some words that a lot of people need to hear right now, "They can tell you how to help, how to plug in, how to learn; because we all have a lot to learn, right? I have never showed up to help a cause and not had a lot to learn about that cause, even the issues that affect me. I often have a lot to learn." [[read it](http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/39191-why-i-threw-out-my-speech-for-the-women-s-march)][tweet it].
