## Link Roundup

We've been public about our commitment to inclusion with Technically Speaking, but less so about things we choose not to include for reasons. Cate wrote up a bit about how we approach that [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/04/18/but-unfortunately-as-you-know-people/)][tweet it].

Did you attend a March for Science at the weekend? [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) put together a collection of famous speeches to mark the occasion [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/04/for-marchforscience-13-famous-speeches.html)][tweet it].

Carol R. Steinberg, a wheelchair using lawyer described some of the challenges this has presented in court [[read it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/opinion/standing-up-for-what-i-need.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I’m always encouraged to see newer courthouses that have ramps at the judge’s bench for lawyers like me. But if my next case isn’t in one of those courthouses, I will ask the judge to come down. Those of us who need accommodation so that we can keep doing what we love must have the courage and self-respect to seek them, even if we would rather we didn’t have to."

[@marcysutton](http://twitter.com/marcysutton) wrote up some advice on putting together abstracts [[read it](https://marcysutton.com/writing-winning-talk-abstracts/)][tweet it]."A proposal is a teaser for your talk. It should tell the reader what they will learn but leave them wanting more. What’s the hook that makes your talk different so it stands out from the rest, without trying too hard?"

[@andrea4animals](https://twitter.com/andrea4animals) is new to tech and struggling to feel that she belongs. She urges woman developers to "attend events and make your presence known", and we wholeheartedly agree. This is a huge part of why we run Technically Speaking: to encourage more underrepresented folks to speak and show others that there is a place for them in the tech industry [[read it](https://code.likeagirl.io/women-developers-wanted-77a3747aeed5)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Woman%20developers,%20make%20your%20presence%20known%20by%20%40andrea4animals%20%20https%3A//code.likeagirl.io/women-developers-wanted-77a3747aeed5%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
