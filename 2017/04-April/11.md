## Link Roundup

Bear with us as we get meta: [@brwngrldev](https://twitter.com/brwngrldev) wrote a  [great review on her newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/brwngrldev/letters/brwngrldev-march-2017) about a podcast on The In's and Out’s of TED/TEDx. "[@tamadear](https://twitter.com/tamadear) talks about how she helps her speakers prepare for their TEDx talks. They have to practice A LOT!" [[listen](https://thespeakerlab.com/tamsen-webster/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20In's%20And%20Out's%20of%20TED/TEDx%20with%20%40tamadear%20https%3A//thespeakerlab.com/tamsen-webster/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@math_rachel](http://twitter.com/math_rachel) captured some reasons why you - yes you! - should blog [[read it](http://www.fast.ai/2017/04/06/alternatives/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Alternatives%20to%20a%20Degree%20to%20Prove%20Yourself%20in%20Deep%20Learning.%20Start%20blogging.%20by%20%40math_rachel%20http%3A//www.fast.ai/2017/04/06/alternatives%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite tip, "Any time you answer a question multiple times through email, you should turn it into a blog post, which makes it easier for you to share the next time someone asks."

Helpful post from [@kavbojka](http://twitter.com/kavbojka) on making events parent-friendly [[read it](https://camilleacey.com/2017/04/05/beyond-childcare-available-4-tips-for-making-events-parent-friendly/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Beyond%20%E2%80%9CChildcare%20Available%E2%80%9D%3A%204%20Tips%20for%20Making%20Events%20Parent-Friendly%20by%20%40kavbojka%20%20https%3A//camilleacey.com/2017/04/05/beyond-childcare-available-4-tips-for-making-events-parent-friendly/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We love this refusal to apologise from [@melissahortman ](http://twitter.com/melissahortman ) [[read it](http://www.citypages.com/news/house-dfl-leader-melissa-hortman-calls-out-white-males-wont-apologize-video/418127203)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=House%20DFL%20leader%20%40melissahortman%20calls%20out%20'white%20males',%20won't%20apologize%20http%3A//www.citypages.com/news/house-dfl-leader-melissa-hortman-calls-out-white-males-wont-apologize-video/418127203%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "I'm really tired of watching women of color, in particular, being ignored. So, I'm not sorry." What an ending!

## Inspiration

[@Cassandra_Hsiao](http://twitter.com/Cassandra_Hsiao)'s admissions essay made us tear up [[read it](http://afterschool.my/news/72793-2/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Admissions%20essay%20by%20%40Cassandra_Hsiao%20on%20learning%20english,%20and%20love.%20http%3A//afterschool.my/news/72793-2/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. On learning english, the difference between spoken and written english, and love.
