Helpful infographic from [@catalystInc](https://twitter.com/catalystInc) about words used to undermine women in the workplace - and what to focus on instead [[read it](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/flip-script-women-workplace-0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Flip%20the%20Script%3A%20Women%20in%20the%20Workplace%20by%20%40catalystInc%20http%3A//www.catalyst.org/knowledge/flip-script-women-workplace-0%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Some people unfortunately need this flowchart to decide whether to ask a "question" [[read it](https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/852902511945986048)].

We love this story from [@eryno](http://twitter.com/eryno) about a male ally at a conference [[read it](https://twitter.com/eryno/status/844374040580177920)]. Our hearts are warmed!

Some great write ups from DroidCon Boston, [@bhlynne](https://twitter.com/bhlynne) wrote about the importance of community by [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-all-community-what-i-learned-weeks-tech-brandi-henson-shailer)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=It's%20All%20About%20Community%3A%20What%20I%20Learned%20at%20%40droidconbos%20by%20%40bhlynne%20https%3A//www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-all-community-what-i-learned-weeks-tech-brandi-henson-shailer%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] and the amazing [@brwngrldev](http://twitter.com/brwngrldev) wrote about her keynote - and wearing a lab coat on stage [[read it](http://adavis.info/2017/04/droidcon-boston-2017-recap.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=DroidCon%20Boston%202017%20Recap%20by%20%40brwngrldev%20http%3A//adavis.info/2017/04/droidcon-boston-2017-recap.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love it!

## Inspiration

Chiu-Ki keynoted DroidCon Boston and asked me (Cate!) to write up a blurb for the newsletter. You can [[read it](http://blog.sqisland.com/2017/04/droidcon-boston-keynote.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Droidcon%20Boston%20Keynote%20http%3A//blog.sqisland.com/2017/04/droidcon-boston-keynote.html%20/by%20%40chiuki%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)], but I hope you're inspired by this point, "That is the beauty of going to a conference: we learn, we share what we learn, and we lift each other up. It was really rewarding to see people getting out of their comfort zone to tweet, blog, sketchnote, and plot to give their very first talk. This is how we build a community."
