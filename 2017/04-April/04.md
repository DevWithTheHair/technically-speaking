Go [submit a talk](http://360andev.com/call-for-papers/)! Deadline is this Friday, April 7.

## Inspiration

[@lleahy](https://twitter.com/lleahy) performed Let Me Code at [@RailsConf](https://twitter.com/RailsConf) 2014. Yes, it's a Frozen parody. Favorite line: "Let the nerds rage on. The trolls never bothered me anyway."
