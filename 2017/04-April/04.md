## Link Roundup

Chiu-Ki hosted a Q&A Hangout for her conference [@360andev](https://twitter.com/360andev), and the recording is online. Lots of discussion on public speaking in general, so give it a watch even if you are not an Android developer. Oh, you are an Android developer? Go [submit a talk](http://360andev.com/call-for-papers/)! Deadline is this Friday, April 7 [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_n8nd5P8Fc)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=CFP%20Q%26A%20Hangout%20by%20%40360AnDev.%20Lots%20of%20great%20public%20speaking%20questions!%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_n8nd5P8Fc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We love this post from [@blprnt](http://twitter.com/blprnt) on the three things he learned in 18 years of public speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@blprnt/the-three-things-i-learned-from-eighteen-years-of-public-speaking-875f01178902)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Three%20Things%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Learned%20From%20Eighteen%20Years%20of%20Public%20Speaking%20https%3A//medium.com/%40blprnt/the-three-things-i-learned-from-eighteen-years-of-public-speaking-875f01178902%20/by%20%40blprnt%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite observation, "Every talk is a narrative. Somehow, though, when we tend to pick the same narrative structure for a talk that we might use when telling a bedtime story to a three year old: beginning, middle, then end. While linear narrative structures indeed score high with toddlers, they tend to be boring for adults."

[@aurelievache](https://twitter.com/aurelievache) wrote a great article for
[@eclipsecon](https://twitter.com/eclipsecon) to encourage you (yes, you!) to submit a talk. She went through common reasons for not speaking and refuted them one by one [[read it](https://www.eclipsecon.org/france2017/news/word-speakers-why-submit-talk)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20word%20for%20speakers%20-%20Why%20submit%20a%20talk?%20by%20%40aurelievache%20https%3A//www.eclipsecon.org/france2017/news/word-speakers-why-submit-talk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

[@lleahy](https://twitter.com/lleahy) performed Let Me Code at [@RailsConf](https://twitter.com/RailsConf) 2014. Yes, it's a Frozen parody. Favorite line: "Let the nerds rage on. The trolls never bothered me anyway."
