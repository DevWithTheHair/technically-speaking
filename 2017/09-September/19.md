## Link Roundup

Incredibly helpful post by [@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem) on making slides accessible to people without perfect vision [[read it](https://medium.com/@dellsystem/i-cant-read-your-slides-737acde6e9dc)][tweet it]. The graphic at the beginning succinctly captures the problem, but do read the entire thing!

Nice writeup of Android Summit from [@SpeakToChris](http://twitter.com/SpeakToChris) [[read it](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/09/05/nexmo-at-android-summit-dr/)][tweet it].

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) writes about how adding women speakers can improve attendance - and the bottom line [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2017/09/want-to-boost-conference-attendance-add.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "Think about the reverse. Conferences where women feel not only safe, but included, and celebrated, are an easy "yes" for both participants and speakers. That might be a women's conference, but it need not be. Any conference can be one where women can see themselves participating at all levels...if it wishes. Build a smart code of conduct, offer fees and travel reimbursement to your speakers, and make it easier for women speakers to say "yes" when you call. After all, women do *not* just want to speak and participate in conferences for women."

We're pretty dismayed at how ReactiveConf have been approaching the lightening talk popularity contest [[read it](https://medium.com/@jevakallio/why-i-will-not-be-speaking-at-reactiveconf-6e106b3816a5)][tweet it]. It's very understandable that [@jevakallio](http://twitter.com/jevakallio) decided not to participate.

This post on the silencing of women by [@ambertamblyn](http://twitter.com/ambertamblyn ) is too real [[read it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-james-woods.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&smtyp=cur)][tweet it]. "I have been afraid of speaking out or asking things of men in positions of power for years. What I have experienced as an actress working in a business whose business is to objectify women is frightening. It is the deep end of a pool where I cannot swim. It is a famous man telling you that you are a liar for what you have remembered. For what you must have misremembered, unless you have proof."
