# Edition 139

This week we have making slides accessible, boosting attendance through inclusion, and breaking the silence.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Germany (Chiu-Ki has been Adventuring) and Whistler (Cate has been at the annual Automattic Grand Meetup).

Our upcoming talks: Cate is speaking at [@pragmamarkorg](http://twitter.com/pragmamarkorg) October, and [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia) in November.

## Link Roundup

Incredibly helpful post by [@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem) on making slides accessible to people without perfect vision [[read it](https://medium.com/@dellsystem/i-cant-read-your-slides-737acde6e9dc)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=I%20can%E2%80%99t%20read%20your%20slides%20%E2%80%93%20Wendy%20Liu%20by%20%40dellsystem%20https%3A//medium.com/%40dellsystem/i-cant-read-your-slides-737acde6e9dc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The graphic at the beginning succinctly captures the problem, but do read the entire thing!

Nice writeup of Android Summit from [@SpeakToChris](http://twitter.com/SpeakToChris) [[read it](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/09/05/nexmo-at-android-summit-dr/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Nexmo%20at%20Android%20Summit%20-%20Nexmo%20by%20%40SpeakToChris%20https%3A//www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/09/05/nexmo-at-android-summit-dr/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) writes about how adding women speakers can improve attendance - and the bottom line [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2017/09/want-to-boost-conference-attendance-add.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Want%20to%20boost%20conference%20attendance%3F%20Add%20women%20speakers%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2017/09/want-to-boost-conference-attendance-add.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "Think about the reverse. Conferences where women feel not only safe, but included, and celebrated, are an easy "yes" for both participants and speakers. That might be a women's conference, but it need not be. Any conference can be one where women can see themselves participating at all levels...if it wishes. Build a smart code of conduct, offer fees and travel reimbursement to your speakers, and make it easier for women speakers to say "yes" when you call. After all, women do *not* just want to speak and participate in conferences for women."

We're pretty dismayed at how ReactiveConf have been approaching the lightening talk popularity contest [[read it](https://medium.com/@jevakallio/why-i-will-not-be-speaking-at-reactiveconf-6e106b3816a5)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20will%20not%20be%20speaking%20at%20ReactiveConf%20%E2%80%93%20Jani%20Ev%C3%A4kallio%20by%20%40jevakallio%20https%3A//medium.com/%40jevakallio/why-i-will-not-be-speaking-at-reactiveconf-6e106b3816a5%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It's very understandable that [@jevakallio](http://twitter.com/jevakallio) decided not to participate.

This post on the silencing of women by [@ambertamblyn](http://twitter.com/ambertamblyn ) is too real [[read it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-james-woods.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&smtyp=cur)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Amber%20Tamblyn%3A%20I%E2%80%99m%20Done%20With%20Not%20Being%20Believed%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Times%20by%20%40ambertamblyn%20https%3A//www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-james-woods.html%3Fsmid%3Dtw-nytopinion%26smtyp%3Dcur%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "I have been afraid of speaking out or asking things of men in positions of power for years. What I have experienced as an actress working in a business whose business is to objectify women is frightening. It is the deep end of a pool where I cannot swim. It is a famous man telling you that you are a liar for what you have remembered. For what you must have misremembered, unless you have proof."
