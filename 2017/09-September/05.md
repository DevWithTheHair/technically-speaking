# Edition 138

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Berlin, where Chiu-Ki is keynoting [@droidconDE](https://twitter.com/droidconDE), and NYC where Cate is co-hosting [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc)

Our upcoming talks: Cate is speaking at [@pragmamarkorg](http://twitter.com/pragmamarkorg) October, and [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia) in November.
