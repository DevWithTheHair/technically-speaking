# Edition 138

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Berlin, where Chiu-Ki is keynoting [@droidconDE](https://twitter.com/droidconDE), and NYC where Cate is co-hosting [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc)

Our upcoming talks: Cate is speaking at [@pragmamarkorg](http://twitter.com/pragmamarkorg) October, and [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia) in November.

## Link Roundup

[@amyngyn](http://twitter.com/amyngyn) wrote about policing the way that women speak - and why we should stop [[read it](https://medium.com/@amyngyn/stop-policing-how-women-speak-7499ba3bb61d)][tweet it]. We couldn't agree more! "...[I]ntersectional feminism can’t be about getting minorities to embrace the dominant culture. This is especially true when the dominant culture is toxic as hell. There are many ways to be successful, but instead of embracing these different styles, we’re blindly telling women to speak more aggressively.

We need feedback on our speaking (and everything!) but it can be hard to get - and hard to process. Cate found the book "Thanks for the Feedback" really helpful [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/07/11/book-thanks-for-the-feedback/)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

When someone has a comment, not a question... We can only dream that we handle it as smoothly as Rep Maxine Waters [[watch it](https://twitter.com/faithchoyce/status/890756142359429120)][tweet it].
