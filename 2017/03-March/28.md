## Link Roundup

This comic by [@yinfanhuang](https://twitter.com/yinfanhuang/status/844757960060481536) is about freelancer life, but it looks just like what happens days before a giving talk [[read it](https://twitter.com/yinfanhuang/status/844757960060481536)].

Great tips from [@zcutlip](https://twitter.com/zcutlip) about submitting to small conference first, get it recorded for your portfolio, and write on the subject even if not required. "Communication is a skill that will serve you well throughout your career. Write early and often." [[read it](https://twitter.com/zcutlip/status/844904876920352769)]

[@cypheroftyr](http://twitter.com/cypheroftyr) on the problem with undiverse diversity panels [[read it](https://medium.com/@cypheroftyr/the-diversity-conversation-has-to-change-47c054842347#.2jhms0n0h)][tweet it]. "There’s a lot of other places I’ve been with same problem but no one thinks about it till after. If they think about it at all, even when it’s pointed out to them. Then it’s a THING especially if it’s pointed out publicly."

[@aballano](https://twitter.com/aballano) offers ten reasons to give a talk [[read it](https://medium.com/@aballano/10-reasons-to-give-at-least-one-public-talk-in-your-life-52ea550ad7d0)][tweet it]. Our favourite is number six - "You might discover that you’re good at it".

Cate wrote up a public speaking experience she's finally ready to laugh about [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/03/28/my-worst-public-speaking-experience)][tweet it]. Don't get on stage with the flu, y'all.
