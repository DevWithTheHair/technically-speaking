## Link Roundup

Women in Open Source is running a webinar on March 9 with [@baconandcoconut]([http://twitter.com/baconandcoconut) on writing winning abstract for a CFP to become a speaker [[read it](https://www.linux.com/blog/webinar/2017/3/free-webinar-how-develop-winning-speaking-submission-deb-nicholson-and-women-open-source)][tweet it].

Really helpful post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) which might inspire you to leave more out of that big talk [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/12/you-are-not-throwing-away-your-shot.html)][tweet it]. This advice is spot on, "Your desire to express yourself is wonderful, but any speech would break down under all that weight. You're asking too much of your 15-minute or 20-minute talk. And you're also underestimating what a good, focused talk will do, which is to generate more invitations for you to speak, creating more opportunities for you to tell those stories you've been collecting."

[@vavroom](https://twitter.com/vavroom) wrote about how - and why - to make events accessible [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-your-conference-accessible-why-you-should-care-steenhout)][tweet it]. "Your event or conference will be more successful if everyone is able to participate fully." Yes!

These comics by [@inkyelbows](https://twitter.com/inkyelbows/) capture so many fears about attending events [[read it](http://inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2012/1/23/comics-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-or-any-writingillustrati.html)][tweet it]. "What if they find out how boring I am when I have to use more than 140 characters at a time?" Been there! We also love the follow up post with tips for first time attendees [[read it](http://inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2017/1/27/tips-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-second-timers-plus-a-chall.html)][tweet it]. Our favourite thing though, was the challenge to many time attendees, *"Try to remember what it was like when you attended your very first event, or how insecure you felt in the beginning. Then make it a personal challenge to find at least one lost-looking or nervous conference newbie who is sitting or standing alone. Introduce yourself, chat with them, find out what they're working on, perhaps (if appropriate) offer some advice."*

## Inspiration

Charming comic from [@SarahCAndersen](https://twitter.com/SarahCAndersen) illustrating fear of public speaking [[read it](https://twitter.com/SarahCAndersen/status/838049389784498176)].
