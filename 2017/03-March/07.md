## Link Roundup

Really helpful post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) which might inspire you to leave more out of that big talk [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/12/you-are-not-throwing-away-your-shot.html)][tweet it]. This advice is spot on, "Your desire to express yourself is wonderful, but any speech would break down under all that weight. You're asking too much of your 15-minute or 20-minute talk. And you're also underestimating what a good, focused talk will do, which is to generate more invitations for you to speak, creating more opportunities for you to tell those stories you've been collecting."
