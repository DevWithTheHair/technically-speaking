## Link Roundup

Women in Open Source is running a webinar on March 9 with [@baconandcoconut]([http://twitter.com/baconandcoconut) on writing winning abstract for a CFP to become a speaker [[read it](https://www.linux.com/blog/webinar/2017/3/free-webinar-how-develop-winning-speaking-submission-deb-nicholson-and-women-open-source)][tweet it].

Really helpful post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) which might inspire you to leave more out of that big talk [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/12/you-are-not-throwing-away-your-shot.html)][tweet it]. This advice is spot on, "Your desire to express yourself is wonderful, but any speech would break down under all that weight. You're asking too much of your 15-minute or 20-minute talk. And you're also underestimating what a good, focused talk will do, which is to generate more invitations for you to speak, creating more opportunities for you to tell those stories you've been collecting."

## Inspiration

Charming comic from [@SarahCAndersen](https://twitter.com/SarahCAndersen) illustrating fear of public speaking [[read it](https://twitter.com/SarahCAndersen/status/838049389784498176)].
