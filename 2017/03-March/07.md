## Link Roundup

Women in Open Source is running a webinar on March 9 with [@baconandcoconut]([http://twitter.com/baconandcoconut) on writing winning abstract for a CFP to become a speaker [[read it](https://www.linux.com/blog/webinar/2017/3/free-webinar-how-develop-winning-speaking-submission-deb-nicholson-and-women-open-source)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Free%20Webinar%20on%20How%20To%20Develop%20a%20Winning%20Speaking%20Submission%20from%20%40baconandcoconut%20https%3A//www.linux.com/blog/webinar/2017/3/free-webinar-how-develop-winning-speaking-submission-deb-nicholson-and-women-open-source%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Really helpful post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) which might inspire you to leave more out of that big talk [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/12/you-are-not-throwing-away-your-shot.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=You%20are%20not%20throwing%20away%20your%20shot%3A%20Don%27t%20load%20up%20that%20big%20speech%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/12/you-are-not-throwing-away-your-shot.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This advice is spot on, "Your desire to express yourself is wonderful, but any speech would break down under all that weight. You're asking too much of your 15-minute or 20-minute talk. And you're also underestimating what a good, focused talk will do, which is to generate more invitations for you to speak, creating more opportunities for you to tell those stories you've been collecting."

[@vavroom](https://twitter.com/vavroom) wrote about how - and why - to make events accessible [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-your-conference-accessible-why-you-should-care-steenhout)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20make%20your%20conference%20accessible%20-%20and%20why%20you%20should%20care!%20by%20%40vavroom%20https%3A//www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-your-conference-accessible-why-you-should-care-steenhout%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "Your event or conference will be more successful if everyone is able to participate fully." Yes!

These comics by [@inkyelbows](https://twitter.com/inkyelbows/) capture so many fears about attending events [[read it](http://inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2012/1/23/comics-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-or-any-writingillustrati.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Comics%20for%20SCBWI%20conference%20newbies%20%28or%20any%20writing/illustrating%20conferences%29%20by%20%40inkyelbows%20%20http%3A//inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2012/1/23/comics-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-or-any-writingillustrati.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "What if they find out how boring I am when I have to use more than 140 characters at a time?" Been there! We also love the follow up post with tips for first time attendees [[read it](http://inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2017/1/27/tips-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-second-timers-plus-a-chall.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tips%20for%20conference%20newbies,%20second-timers,%20plus%20a%20CHALLENGE%20for%20many-timers%20by%20%40inkyelbows%20http%3A//inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2017/1/27/tips-for-scbwi-conference-newbies-second-timers-plus-a-chall.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite thing though, was the challenge to many time attendees, *"Try to remember what it was like when you attended your very first event, or how insecure you felt in the beginning. Then make it a personal challenge to find at least one lost-looking or nervous conference newbie who is sitting or standing alone. Introduce yourself, chat with them, find out what they're working on, perhaps (if appropriate) offer some advice."*
