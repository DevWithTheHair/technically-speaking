## Link Roundup

We love this from [@purpleyay](http://twitter.com/purpleyay) on learning to speak imperfectly [[read it](http://gwendolyn.io/learning-to-speak-imperfectly/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Learning%20to%20Speak%20Imperfectly%20by%20%40purpleyay%20http%3A//gwendolyn.io/learning-to-speak-imperfectly/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "There are people who might fault you for speaking imperfectly, but there are also people who will appreciate you for your vulnerability, support you in it, and even teach you something new."

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught)'s Famous Speech Friday of Viola Davis's Golden Globes Meryl Streep intro has a ton of wisdom as to what makes a great introduction [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/famous-speech-friday-viola-daviss.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Famous%20Speech%20Friday%3A%20Viola%20Davis%27s%20Golden%20Globes%20Meryl%20Streep%20intro%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2017/02/famous-speech-friday-viola-daviss.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway, "Every introduction is a small speech, one that translates the person being introduced to the audience."

This thread about being a woman at a game developer conference by [@Laralyn](http://twitter.com/Laralyn) is too real [[read it](https://twitter.com/Laralyn/status/830172440776957952)].

If you don't feel like you're enough of an expert to give a talk, follow the "inventory method" outlined by [@kecatlin](http://twitter.com/kecatlin) [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-dont-have-expert-share-your-expertise-karen-catlin)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20be%20an%20expert%20to%20share%20your%20expertise%20by%20%40kecatlin%20https%3A//www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-dont-have-expert-share-your-expertise-karen-catlin%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We suspect you'll surprise yourself.

[@kelseyhightower](http://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) wrote, "If I don’t see someone who looks like me, I immediately assume I’ll be fighting an uphill battle, and start questioning what makes me so special that I’ll be the first black person given an opportunity to speak at their conference. Representation matters, and it’s the main reason I accept so many speaking opportunities: I want to be the reflection some people are looking for."

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this EU parliament member calling out some atrocious sexism in the moment. Notice how she make his abstract comments personal, and ends owning her responsibilities and power, "I am here to defend all European women from men like you."
