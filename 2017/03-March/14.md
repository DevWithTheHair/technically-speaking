## Link Roundup

We love this from [@purpleyay](http://twitter.com/purpleyay) on learning to speak imperfectly [[read it](http://gwendolyn.io/learning-to-speak-imperfectly/)][tweet it]. Key quote, "There are people who might fault you for speaking imperfectly, but there are also people who will appreciate you for your vulnerability, support you in it, and even teach you something new."

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this EU parliament member calling out some atrocious sexism in the moment. Notice how she make his abstract comments personal, and ends owning her responsibilities and power, "I am here to defend all European women from men like you." [[watch it](https://www.facebook.com/TelePolitics/videos/1124748420987424/)][tweet it].
