*From [@benjaminencz](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz): I love the diversity of the peer group of speakers at 360|iDev. Since everyone goes through the CFP process, this conference features speakers that you wouldn't see at a lot of other iOS focused conferences where the majority of speakers are invited.*

## Link Roundup

I'm sure at one point or another, we've all felt what [Fiona Condon](https://twitter.com/fioroco/status/841044811583016961) has felt when preparing a talk: "i love preparing technical talks, my apartment has never been so clean"

## Inspiration

This week, a bit of inspiration in the form of experienced speaker's `/speaking` pages! 

I love [Yesenia Perez-Cruz](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/speaking/)'s thumbnail for each talk on her page; it highlights the wide range of setups you might encounter as a speaker!

[Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking/)'s upcoming events and past events list include my favorite detail: the flag of the country where the event is located!

[Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/speaking/)'s page lists some quotes from attendees alongside video highlights and examples of the kinds of content she likes to cover. This feels like a SUPER effective way at showcasing prospective events what you're excited to share with their audience.

And [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/speaking)' page includes a high-level summary, a few video examples, and a GORGEOUSLY organized list of upcoming and previous events!
