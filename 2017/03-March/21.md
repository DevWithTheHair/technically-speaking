## Inspiration

This week, a bit of inspiration in the form of experienced speaker's `/speaking` pages! 

I love [Yesenia Perez-Cruz](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/speaking/)'s thumbnail for each talk on her page; it highlights the wide range of setups you might encounter as a speaker!

[Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking/)'s upcoming events and past events list include my favorite detail: the flag of the country where the event is located!

[Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/speaking/)'s page lists some quotes from attendees alongside video highlights and examples of the kinds of content she likes to cover. This feels like a SUPER effective way at showcasing prospective events what you're excited to share with their audience.
