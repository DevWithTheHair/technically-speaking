# Edition 117

Cate has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@lara_hogan](http://twitter.com/lara_hogan).

*[Lara Hogan](http://larahogan.me) is an Engineering Director at Etsy and the author of the new book [Demystifying Public Speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking), which covers choosing a talk topic, finding a venue, clothing and event-day considerations, and lots more - including tips and tactics for members of underrepresented groups who have concerns about safety while public speaking. She also believes it's important to celebrate career achievements with [donuts](http://larahogan.me/donuts/).*

This week we have CFP Q&A, a great talk, follow-up on speaker fee, and a showcase of speaker pages.

Thanks to this week's sponsor - an internet friend of Technically Speaking who wishes to remain anonymous. Thank you!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Brooklyn and Colorado.

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is keynoting [@droidconbos](http://twitter.com/droidconbos), April 10-11 in Boston. Cate is speaking at [@uikonf](http://twitter.com/uikonf) May 14-17 in Berlin and [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) June 8-9 in London (as is Lara!).

*From [@benjaminencz](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz): I love the diversity of the peer group of speakers at 360|iDev. Since everyone goes through the CFP process, this conference features speakers that you wouldn't see at a lot of other iOS focused conferences where the majority of speakers are invited.*

## Link Roundup

Chiu-Ki is organizing [@360andev](https://twitter.com/360andev) again, and will be hosting a Q&A Hangout at noon MDT on March 21. Come ask your public speaking questions, whether or  not you plan to submit to the conference [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_n8nd5P8Fc)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Get%20public%20speaking%20tips%20at%20the%20%40360andev%20CFP%20Q%26A%20Hangout%3A%20March%2021%20noon%20MDT%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_n8nd5P8Fc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

I'm sure at one point or another, we've all felt what [@fioroco](https://twitter.com/fioroco) has felt when preparing a talk: "i love preparing technical talks, my apartment has never been so clean" [[read it](https://twitter.com/fioroco/status/841044811583016961)].

We received an excellent link suggestion from [@nitya](https://twitter.com/nitya) through the Technically Speaking's GitHub repo! Check out her full thoughts [here](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/318) on [@omojumiller](https://twitter.com/omojumiller)'s Code as Craft talk, "What really makes a coder? A machine learning approach to the tech pipeline" [[watch it](https://codeascraft.com/speakers/omoju-miller-what-really-makes-a-coder-a-machine-learning-approach-to-the-tech-pipeline/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20really%20makes%20a%20coder?%20A%20machine%20learning%20approach%20to%20the%20tech%20pipeline%20by%20%40omojumiller%20https%3A//codeascraft.com/speakers/omoju-miller-what-really-makes-a-coder-a-machine-learning-approach-to-the-tech-pipeline/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Nitya wrote, "If there is one thing I would take away from this talk, it is that we, each and every one of us in this industry, need to ask what "belonging" means to different genders, ethnicities, ages and levels of experience - and ask whether the work environment provides enough flexibility to support those needs."

We shared this [thread of being paid to speak](https://storify.com/Luvvie/about-speaking-conferences-exposure-income-and-pay) by [@Luvvie](https://twitter.com/Luvvie) a few weeks ago. [@cmwalla](https://twitter.com/cmwalla) wrote an article with more background, including compensation information from other speakers [[read it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinawallace/2017/03/13/pay-gap-for-speakers-at-tech-conferences)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=It's%20Time%20To%20End%20The%20Pay%20Gap%20For%20Speakers%20At%20Tech%20Conferences%20by%20%40cmwalla%20https%3A//www.forbes.com/sites/christinawallace/2017/03/13/pay-gap-for-speakers-at-tech-conferences%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Make sure you read the update at the end, which is the response from the conference organizers [[read it](https://twitter.com/Luvvie/status/841714404731322370)]. Yes, they managed to make the situation even worse.

Have you used blank slides in your talk? [@FMuntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu) tried it in her recent talk, using blank slides to direct the audience focus on her when she was telling her story
[[read it](https://medium.com/upday-devs/a-public-speaking-experiment-blank-slides-c2fc09289825)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20Public%20Speaking%20Experiment%3A%20Blank%20Slides%20by%20%40FMuntenescu%20https%3A//medium.com/upday-devs/a-public-speaking-experiment-blank-slides-c2fc09289825%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

This week, a bit of inspiration in the form of experienced speaker's `/speaking/` pages!

I love [Yesenia Perez-Cruz](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/speaking/)'s thumbnail for each talk on her page; it highlights the wide range of setups you might encounter as a speaker!

[Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking/)'s upcoming events and past events list include my favorite detail: the flag of the country where the event is located!

[Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/speaking/)'s page lists some quotes from attendees alongside video highlights and examples of the kinds of content she likes to cover. This feels like a SUPER effective way at showcasing prospective events what you're excited to share with their audience.

And [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/speaking/)' page includes a high-level summary, a few video examples, and a GORGEOUSLY organized list of upcoming and previous events!
