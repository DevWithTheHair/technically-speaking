Happy New Year! We have a few exciting announcements for you.

## New Logo

We worked with the talented [@vpoltrack](https://twitter.com/vpoltrack) to update our logo, and we love it! Hope you like it too.

## Contribution Guidelines

Did you know that Technically Speaking is Open Source? This means you can contribute by [submit issues](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/new)! We don't see a lot of submissions though, so we added
[contribute guidelines](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to clarify what we are looking for. Please, please submit!

## Sponsors

By now you probably noticed that this is not a regular issue. We are taking a break because we need more sponsors. Please
[get in touch](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/) if you like what we are doing and want to make it sustainable.

As always, thank you to our sustaining sponsors [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge), [@Kickstarter](http://twitter.com/kickstarter) and [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci).
