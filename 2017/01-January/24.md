# Edition 109

HAPPY 2017! We hope your year is off to a great start! We really enjoyed our little break but now we're back with a bang!

Whilst we weren't sending weekly emails, we did a couple of other things. Firstly, we improved our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - we love it when y'all submit great things you've read about speaking, and we wanted that to be more clear. You're welcome to submit your own content, but we know that can be scary, so why not submit the great things your friends write? We want to read them!

Secondly, we put together [our report for 2016](https://cate.blog/2017/01/24/technically-speaking-2016-emoji-report/). We hope you like all the emoji! It would be amazing if you would [tweet it it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20the%20%40techspeakdigest%202016%20emoji%20report!%20https%3A//cate.blog/2017/01/24/technically-speaking-2016-emoji-report/). We'd also encourage you to share it with budget-controlling-people, perhaps with a mention that we have [sponsorships available](https://techspeak.email/sponsorship/). We're particuarly looking for sustaining sponsors who share our values around inclusion.

This week we have `what`

Thanks to this week's sponsor - an internet friend of Technically Speaking who wishes to remain anonymous. Thank you!

## Link Roundup

We're looking out for speaking retrospectives so please send us yours if you write one! Thanks to [@martinb3](http://twitter.com/martinb3) for sharing his [[read it](http://martinb3.io/public-speaking-2016/)][tweet it]. One thing we particularly liked was the goal around events to attend but not speak at - not speaking definitely makes events less stressful which can mean more fun!

We love this post from [@cjlew23](http://twitter.com/cjlew23) on how she's used public speaking to grow her business as a CEO (driving 38% of sales!) [[read it](https://m.signalvnoise.com/what-i-learned-speaking-at-events-as-a-ceo-for-the-past-2-5-years-8c772664af23#.cmwikl9lc)][tweet it]. This tip is an important oneto keep in mind, though, "Aim to be helpful, not self-promotional. When pitching your talk to the event or conference, look to provide helpful insights — not to sell your product or service. What’s a burning question or pain that your audience has?"

As 2016 ended, it was hard not to feel like we were taking a step back in terms of gender equality. This collection by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) reminds us that women made a tremendous amount of impact last year by speaking up [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.uy/2016/12/the-10-most-important-speeches-by-women.html)][tweet it]. Now to see what 2017 will bring... 

## Inspiration

We are in awe of this amazing talk by [@szechuan](http://twitter.com/szechuan) [[read it](http://www.sachajudd.com/one-direction)][tweet it]. She draws us in with a fascinating story about One Direction, gets us questioning why it is that the things that teenage girls love are disparaged, and drives home an important point about "the pipeline".
