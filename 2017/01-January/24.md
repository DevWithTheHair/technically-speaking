# Edition 109

HAPPY 2017! We hope your year is off to a great start! We really enjoyed our little break but now we're back with a bang!

Whilst we weren't sending weekly emails, we did a couple of other things. Firstly, we improved our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - we love it when y'all submit great things you've read about speaking, and we wanted that to be more clear. You're welcome to submit your own content, but we know that can be scary, so why not submit the great things your friends write? We want to read them!

Secondly, we put together [our report for 2016](https://cate.blog/2017/01/24/technically-speaking-2016-emoji-report/). We hope you like all the emoji! It would be amazing if you would [tweet it it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20the%20%40techspeakdigest%202016%20emoji%20report!%20https%3A//cate.blog/2017/01/24/technically-speaking-2016-emoji-report/). We'd also encourage you to share it with budget-controlling-people, perhaps with a mention that we have [sponsorships available](https://techspeak.email/sponsorship/). We're particuarly looking for sustaining sponsors who share our values around inclusion.

This week we have `what`

Thanks to this week's sponsor - an internet friend of Technically Speaking who wishes to remain anonymous. Thank you!

## Inspiration

As 2016 ended, it was hard not to feel like we were taking a step back in terms of gender equality. This collection by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) reminds us that women made a tremendous amount of impact last year by speaking up [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.uy/2016/12/the-10-most-important-speeches-by-women.html)][tweet it]. Now to see what 2017 will bring...
