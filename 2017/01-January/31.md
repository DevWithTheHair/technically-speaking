## Link Roundup

Great guidelines from [@GopherCon](https://twitter.com/GopherCon) on how to  write a successful proposal. Best tip: Don't wait till the last minute. If something is missing, the reviewers may reach out and encourage you to update your proposal [[read it](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/gophercon-2017/writing-a-successful-gophercon-proposal/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Writing%20a%20successful%20%40GopherCon%20proposal%20by%20%40davecheney%20https%3A//blog.gopheracademy.com/gophercon-2017/writing-a-successful-gophercon-proposal/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We love that [@helloconTO](http://twitter.com/helloconTO) is tweeting talk ideas [[read it](https://twitter.com/helloconTO)]. For example, "Programming without a traditional keyboard interface" - we'd watch that!

Comprehensive guide from [@wiredferret](https://twitter.com/wiredferret) on how to become a speaker. We like her thought process of finding a good value exchange and value match. Sometimes it means you have to make the hard choice of saying no after they accepted your talk. "It's the sort of resource I wish I had around when I started speaking." [[read it](http://www.heidiwaterhouse.com/2017/01/16/lady-speaker-cfp-submissions/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Comprehensive%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20become%20a%20speaker%20by%20%40wiredferret%0Ahttp%3A//www.heidiwaterhouse.com/2017/01/16/lady-speaker-cfp-submissions/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

We love that [@anjuan](https://twitter.com/anjuan) included corporate events in
his speaking retrospective [[read it](http://www.anjuansimmons.com/speaking/2016publicspeakingretrospective
)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=2016%20speaking%20retrospective%20by%20%40anjuan%0Ahttp%3A//www.anjuansimmons.com/speaking/2016publicspeakingretrospective%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Public speaking is not just about conferences. Presenting to your co-workers is important too!


## Inspiration

This transcript from Zadie Smith's acceptance speech for the Welt Literature Prize is beautiful, and as you read it you can see how it was written to be spoken. We love it [[read it](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/12/22/on-optimism-and-despair/)][tweet it].
