## Link Roundup
@micheletitolo outlines in painstaking detail how she writes her talks. I appreciate that she outlines how long the process takes her (and how long creating the blogpost took her!) and I especially love the picture of the handwritten notepad pages with her early outline. Writing and delivering a good talk is hard work! [read it](https://michele.io/how-i-create-talks/)[tweet it].

## Inspiration

We were inspired this week by the strength and courage of the women of France's Mwasi Collectif. After a bunch of National Front and far-right trolls screamed racism at the fact that the collective had organized many black women-only sessions as part of their Nyansapo Festival, Parisian mayor Ann Hidalgo (a self-proclaimed feminist, *eyeroll*) and a bunch of so-called antiracist groups took the bait and came after festival organizers. Fortunately all it took was a little [black girl magic](http://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/149970/black-girl-magic-meaning) to get the mayor to back off, but not before she sent a ["Mission Accomplished"-type tweet](http://time.com/4797567/paris-mayor-black-feminist-festival/). According to organizers, “After lying about the Afro-feminist festival ‘banning whites,’ [the] Mayor of Paris lied again, claiming she forced us to change the event. We already planned to hold workshops for black women in a private space ― [the] mayor falsely [took] credit for our plan.” We are glad the festival is going on as planned and hope the sessions are productive and restorative after all this stress!
