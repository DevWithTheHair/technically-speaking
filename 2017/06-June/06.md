# Edition 128

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

We're really excited to have guest editor [@kavbojka] (http://twitter.com/kavbojka) this week! We've appreciated many of her [blog posts](https://camilleacey.com/blog/) and were excited to see her speak at The Lead Developer in NYC earlier this year about developers and support. 

According to Camille, _"Wow, everyone, this is a total 'student becomes the master' moment for me. I was inspired to begin speaking at technical conferences by many of fabulous women I know in the industry but Technically Speaking gave me the actual tools and courage to pursue actual speaking gigs. It is a great honor to be able to be part of carrying this great message to the next batch of lady speakers, because like the TS shirt says, we all truly do 'have something to say'!"_

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from NYC and London - where Cate is speaking at The Lead Developer.

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running [@360andev](http://twitter.com/360andev), July 13-14 in Denver. Cate is speaking at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) June 8-9 in London, and co-hosting [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) September 5th and 6th in NYC!

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote about why and how she works with someone else to create slide decks [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/06/01/who-made-your-slides-not-me/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%E2%80%9CWho%20Made%20Your%20Slides%3F%E2%80%9D%20%28Not%20Me%29%20%E2%80%93%20Accidentally%20in%20Code%20https%3A//cate.blog/2017/06/01/who-made-your-slides-not-me/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Working with someone else to create the deck is a good opportunity to step back from your slides and consider what you want them to communicate.

We were inspired this week by the strength and courage of the women of France's Mwasi Collectif. After a bunch of National Front and far-right trolls screamed racism at the fact that the collective had organized many black women-only sessions as part of their Nyansapo Festival, Parisian mayor Ann Hidalgo (a self-proclaimed feminist, *eyeroll*) and a bunch of so-called antiracist groups took the bait and came after festival organizers. Fortunately all it took was a little [black girl magic](http://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/149970/black-girl-magic-meaning) to get the mayor to back off, but not before she sent a ["Mission Accomplished"-type tweet](http://time.com/4797567/paris-mayor-black-feminist-festival/). According to organizers, “After lying about the Afro-feminist festival ‘banning whites,’ [the] Mayor of Paris lied again, claiming she forced us to change the event. We already planned to hold workshops for black women in a private space ― [the] mayor falsely [took] credit for our plan.” We are glad the festival is going on as planned and hope the sessions are productive and restorative after all this stress!

[@micheletitolo](http://twitter.com/micheletitolo) outlined in painstaking detail how she writes her talks. We appreciate that she highlighted how long the process takes her (and also how long creating this blogpost took her!), and we especially love the picture of the handwritten notepad pages with her early outline. Writing and delivering a good talk is hard work! [[read it](https://michele.io/how-i-create-talks/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20I%20Create%20Talks%20%C2%B7%20Michele%20Titolo%20by%20%40micheletitolo%20https%3A//michele.io/how-i-create-talks/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Fostering diversity at events requires commitment throughout the entire organization, and this was evidenced this week when  it was revealed that GitHub's ElectronConf committee had selected an all-male panel. The blowback was swift and decisive, and the event was quickly postponed. In this post [[read it](https://subfictional.com/how-could-github-announce-an-all-male-conference-line-up-the-same-week-it-shares-results-from-an-oss-demographics-survey-with-3-women/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20could%20GitHub%20announce%20an%20all-male%20conference%20line%20up%20the%20same%20week%20it%20shares%20results%20from%20an%20OSS%20demographics%20survey%20with%203%25%20women%3F%20%7C%20Subfictional%20Studios%20by%20%40christi3k%20https%3A//subfictional.com/how-could-github-announce-an-all-male-conference-line-up-the-same-week-it-shares-results-from-an-oss-demographics-survey-with-3-women/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] [@christi3k](http://twitter.com/christi3k) explores how this could have occurred in light of the organization's so-called commitment to diversity. "Unfortunately simply hiring prominent diversity folks doesn’t actually solve systemic organizational issues. Those skilled in diversity & inclusion can help plan and guide improvements, but leadership has to do the hard emotional labor." 

Interesting post about changing the name of an event - the fears people had, and what turned out to be the case [[read it](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/24/whats-in-a-name-organizing-wordcamps-and-developing-the-finnish-community/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%E2%80%99s%20in%20a%20name%3F%20Organizing%20WordCamps%20and%20developing%20the%20Finnish%20community%20%E2%80%93%20Make%20WordPress%20Community%20https%3A//make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/24/whats-in-a-name-organizing-wordcamps-and-developing-the-finnish-community/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

[@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) consistently gives great talks that I always want to immediately share with many people since they are so informative and actionable. At this recent Signal Conference talk [watch it](https://youtu.be/93ewk2pooAw), she talks about the dangers of leaving data lying around everywhere. "The important thing to remember about data is that it is not neutral. It is sitting there being a threat surface." (***Trigger warning for mention of miscarriage***)
