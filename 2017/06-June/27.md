## Link Roundup

Detailed post by [@crafty](https://twitter.com/crafty) on how he creates presentations with lots of motion in them. He goes through the steps of how he exports the slides from Keynote as images and videos, then upload to Google Photo to share the deck as an album. We really appreciate the level of details [[read it](https://medium.com/@crafty/moving-presentations-d4f895e78de3)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Exporting%20images%20%26%20videos%20from%20Keynote%20to%20Google%20Photos%20to%20share%20animated%20slides%20by%20%40crafty%20https%3A//medium.com/%40crafty/moving-presentations-d4f895e78de3%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

[@jros](http://twitter.com/jros) sent us [a note](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/432) on how she spoke for the first time at a tech conference, [We Rise Women](https://werise.tech) hosted by [@WWCAtl](https://twitter.com/WWCAtl). She said, "It was a great experience, and I met a ton of interesting new folks in technology." Congratulations, Jessica [[read it](https://jessicaowensby.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/speaking-at-my-first-technical-conference/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Speaking%20at%20my%20first%20technical%20conference%20by%20%40jros%20https%3A//jessicaowensby.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/speaking-at-my-first-technical-conference/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

Cate wrote about how she still gets nervous speaking and some of the approaches she takes to handling and mitigating that [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/06/15/speaking-and-nerves/)][tweet it]. Most important point, "Speak, or don’t – I believe in choices, not pushing anyone into anything. But fear is not failure, it’s just information – and very, very normal."

Interesting article about women in podcasting - women hosted shows are just 13% of US podcasts, and 12% of UK [[read it](http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/05/broad-casting)][tweet it]. Manoush Zomorodi argued that “listening to female-hosted shows is actually a feminist act, whether you mean it to be or not.” Damn.


## Inspiration

We're inspired by [@AnArtistWarrior](http://twitter.com/AnArtistWarrior) who witnessing a panel moderators blatant sexism talking over the one woman on the panal eventually said - from the audience - "Let. Her. Speak. Please!" [[read it](https://www.facebook.com/marilee.talkington/posts/10155051385188961?pnref=story)][tweet it].
