## Link Roundup

Cate wrote a bit about panels and what she doesn't like about them [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/06/08/on-panels/)[tweet it]. What kind of speaking are you uncomfortable with? And what would getting more comfortable with it look like?

## Inspiration

Watch this girl calmly announce that she's going to sing one of the hardest songs ever. And then, watch her blow everyone away [[watch it](https://twitter.com/greatvaluetrash/status/870368007423369216)].
