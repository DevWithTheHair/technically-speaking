## Link Roundup

Cate wrote a bit about panels and what she doesn't like about them [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/06/08/on-panels/)[tweet it]. What kind of speaking are you uncomfortable with? And what would getting more comfortable with it look like?

Interesting article by [@BobbieC](https://twitter.com/BobbieC) about why women turn down speaking invitations [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-women-turn-down-speaking-invitations-bobbie-carlton)][tweet it]. "Some invites come in only a few days ahead of an event – making it obvious they are the second choice, the replacement or the remedy for a panel that has been called out for lack of diversity. If you are booking speakers at the last minute, women are more likely to say “no thanks” because they don’t have the personal or professional flexibility."

Helpful list of CfP submission tips from [@wendynather](http://twitter.com/wendynather) [[read it](https://twitter.com/wendynather/status/866059454609018880)]. Our favourite is this, "Don't tell us just what you're going to talk about; tell us what you're going to SAY."

## Inspiration

Watch this girl calmly announce that she's going to sing one of the hardest songs ever. And then, watch her blow everyone away [[watch it](https://twitter.com/greatvaluetrash/status/870368007423369216)].
