From [@kelleyrobinson](https://twitter.com/kelleyrobinson): There are so many resources out there for how to give a great talk, but fewer that encourage people to make the leap!

## Inspiration

Fantastic write up by [@brainpickings](http://twitter.com/brainpickings) about Elie Wiesel's Nobel Prize speech [[read it](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/10/elie-wiesel-nobel-prize-speech/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Elie%20Wiesel%E2%80%99s%20Timely%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize%20Acceptance%20Speech%20by%20%40brainpickings%20https%3A//www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/10/elie-wiesel-nobel-prize-speech/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This quote, "We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere." reminds us to keep going, to keep picking a side.
