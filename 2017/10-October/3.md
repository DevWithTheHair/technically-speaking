*From [@valera_zakharov](https://twitter.com/valera_zakharov): Loved my experience at Craft. Held in beautiful Budapest, Craft is a multidisciplinary conference focused on software craftsmanship. The mix of presentations was well balanced between in-depth tech talks and broader topics. The mobile track was iOS-heavy, but as an Android developer, I found the cross-pollination of ideas to be very useful. Bonus the organizers for the very cool venue (outdoor train museum), good food and, in general, a well organized experience.*

## Link Roundup

[@vmbrasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur) answers 3 quintessential questions from new speakers: How to find topic to present? Am I the best person to present a particular topic? How to find the right event/conference to start?

Global Diversity CFP Day ([@gdcfpday](https://twitter.com/gdcfpday)) is happening on February 3, 2018, and it is a great effort to get more people from underrepresented groups to submit to conferences. They made it super easy to run your own workshop, so sign up and make it happen, wherever you live!
