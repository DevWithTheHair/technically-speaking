*From [@valera_zakharov](https://twitter.com/valera_zakharov): Loved my experience at Craft. Held in beautiful Budapest, Craft is a multidisciplinary conference focused on software craftsmanship. The mix of presentations was well balanced between in-depth tech talks and broader topics. The mobile track was iOS-heavy, but as an Android developer, I found the cross-pollination of ideas to be very useful. Bonus the organizers for the very cool venue (outdoor train museum), good food and, in general, a well organized experience.*

## Link Roundup

Great thread from [@mipsytipsy](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/) on the benefits of public speaking. It isn't about gaining fame, but learning to craft a narrative, communicate your thoughts, be an active listener, and comfortably own a room. "Knowing tech and being able to talk about it are two very different skill sets, and it's the combination that is truly a superpower" [[read it](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/912103246017294336)].

[@vmbrasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur) answers 3 quintessential questions from new speakers: How to find topic to present? Am I the best person to present a particular topic? How to find the right event/conference to start? [[read it](http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2017/09/11/advice-for-new-speakers/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Advice%20for%20new%20speakers%20from%20%40vmbrasseur%20http%3A//anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2017/09/11/advice-for-new-speakers%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Before you jump into preparing a talk, [@juliaferraioli](https://twitter.com/juliaferraioli) recommends that you listen to other talks and read the track descriptions to get a sense of what the conference looks for. With that in mind, write an abstract that is "anything but abstract". Be specific!

Ready for some action? Global Diversity CFP Day ([@gdcfpday](https://twitter.com/gdcfpday)) is happening on February 3, 2018, and it is a great effort to get more people from underrepresented groups to submit to conferences. They made it super easy to run your own workshop, so sign up and make it happen, wherever you live! [[do it](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Global%20Diversity%20CFP%20Day%20is%20Feb%203,%202018.%20Run%20a%20workshop%20w%20guidance%20from%20%40gdcfpday!%20https%3A//www.globaldiversitycfpday.com%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

To round it up, here is a comprehensive public speaking guide by [@hynek](https://twitter.com/hynek): Idea, CFP, outline, slides, polish, practice, travel, and showtime! Yup, it's super detailed, but you know what's the punch line? "Donâ€™t overthink it and do it.". We agree!
