*From [@valera_zakharov](https://twitter.com/valera_zakharov): Loved my experience at Craft. Held in beautiful Budapest, Craft is a multidisciplinary conference focused on software craftsmanship. The mix of presentations was well balanced between in-depth tech talks and broader topics. The mobile track was iOS-heavy, but as an Android developer, I found the cross-pollination of ideas to be very useful. Bonus the organizers for the very cool venue (outdoor train museum), good food and, in general, a well organized experience.*
