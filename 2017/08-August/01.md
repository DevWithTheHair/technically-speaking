## Link Roundup

It is a lot of work to put on a conference. Why do people do it? For
[@adactio](https://twitter.com/adactio), "The whole point of having a conference in the first place is to trigger some kind of change. If you’re not happy with the current make-up of the web community (and I most definitely am not), then a conference is the perfect opportunity to try to demonstrate an alternative [[read it](https://adactio.com/journal/12595)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Putting%20on%20a%20conference,%20triggering%20change%20by%20%40adactio%0Ahttps%3A//adactio.com/journal/12595%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]."

[@nodunayo](https://twitter.com/nodunayo) created Speakline to "showcase speakers' proposals and timelines to demystify the CFP process and help new speakers get started." Browse around, and submit yours [[read it](http://speakerline.io)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Speakerline%3A%20Repository%20of%20proposals%20%26%20timelines%20to%20demystify%20the%20CFP%20process%20by%20%40nodunayo%20http%3A//speakerline.io%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

Love this interview with [@whitecoatcapxg](http://twitter.com/whitecoatcapxg) [[read it](https://louderthanten.com/coax/an-interview-with-norma-miller)][tweet it]. We really appreciate events investing in high quality captioning - it makes a big difference to many people - and this interview really helps highlight why, as well of some of the things that are really hard!

Great [@ch9](https://twitter.com/ch9) discussion on all things public speaking. Practicing, pauses vs filler words, speaking slower, scripts, sparse notes as safety blanket, live coding, getting started, watching your own talk, travel expenses and more [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY5Q9jw0n4g)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20speaking%20by%20%40shanselman%20%40gotheap%20%40LadyNaggaga%20%40kuhlenhuth%20%40DonovanBrown%20on%20%40ch9%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY5Q9jw0n4g%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

Great article from [@zoonini](http://twitter.com/zoonini) about the phenomenon - and effects - of interrupting speakers [[read it](https://getspeak.in/2017/07/24/stop-interrupting/)][tweet it]. We couldn't agree more with this point "Your desire to express your opinion is not more important than the speaker’s right to finish their talk without being interrupted. Interrupting a speaker is disrespectful – you are throwing off their focus, disturbing their flow, and messing with their timing." Also - we have to applaud her for calling out the impromptu questioner!


## Inspiration

We are inspired by all the speakers sharing their
[#SpeakerConfessions](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpeakerConfessions). They may
be speaking for a long time, but they are still nervous, still worried about
Q & A, still not sure what will come out of their mouths. Why keep speaking then?
The impact. The difference they make in people's lives [[read it](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpeakerConfessions)].
