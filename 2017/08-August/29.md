## Link Roundup

Lovely story about the impact of WeFestival from [@SaraJChipps](http://twitter.com/SaraJChipps) [[read it](https://medium.com/@SaraJChipps/thank-you-wefestival-cefd7d26abf1)][tweet it].

Great deconstruction of Mary Beard's Speech "The Public Voice of Women" [[read it](https://imogenmorley.wordpress.com/2017/07/05/anatomy-of-a-speech-the-public-voice-of-women-mary-beard/)][tweet it]. The topic of the speech is close to our hearts, "This is a speech about silence: specifically, the historical and continuing silence of women in the public sphere. By relating her own very modern experiences of online abuse to the silence of women in the public sphere more generally, she describes how women’s silence in the public sphere is still a problem – because of history and public abuse. She links the abuse that many women still face, working in male-dominated arenas such as technology and politics, both in their day-to-day working lives and when they speak in public. This silence stops women being the leaders they could be and holds society back."

Cate wrote up a transparency report after a Code of Conduct violation [[read it](https://blog.tryswift.co/concerning-code-of-conduct)][tweet it]. Key quote, "We’re sharing this in the spirit of transparency, because we believe that having a Code of Conduct is easy, enforcement is harder, and an event that cannot enforce their Code of Conduct would be better off not having one at all."

We love this Famous Speech Friday about Japan's first Lady Akie Abe [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2017/07/famous-speech-friday-japan-first-lady.html)][tweet it] from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught). Our favourite lesson from is is "Have a non-standard start and finish" - "Starts and endings are places to be strong, to give emphasis, and to alert the audience of what's ahead in your speech and in the discussion to follow. Don't waste them on trivialities."

[@geekygirlsarah](https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah) shared some thoughts on why she stopped submitting to conferences for a while [[read it](https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/07/27/why-i-stopped-submitting-talks-to-conferences-this-year/)][tweet it]. It's important to note what a difference covering travel makes! This is why we always include that in the CfPs in this newsletter. For speakers - we totally agree it's reasonable to expect your travel and accomodation to be covered, and to not speak otherwise.

## Inspiration

We're so inspired by [@JillWetzler](http://twitter.com/JillWetzler)'s [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) talk [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOAF1C4T5ak)][tweet it]! Notice how she ties together threads from other talks throughout the event. She also has really good pacing and the talk itself is very tweetable. Can you believe this was her first big conference talk? We think part of it is choosing a subject she understands in so much depth.
