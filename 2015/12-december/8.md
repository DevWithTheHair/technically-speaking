# Edtion 56

Join us for our December webinar on Dec 18 with [@mindweather](https://twitter.com/mindweather) where we will be talking about deeper learning from failure and success, with special guest co-host [@KellyShuster](https://twitter.com/KellyShuster) [[sign up](http://goo.gl/forms/NYRQ98HM19)]. Dave is the head of engineering at Pandora's Next Big Sound, and recently published [Beyond Blame](http://bit.ly/beyondblame) which uncovers some of the most powerful short-circuits to learning (blame and biases) and ways to overcome them.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them since the start of the year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

## Link Roundup  

We love it when people write about their process for prepping a talk, but the thought of prepping an Ignite talk a matter of hours as described by [@xaprb](https://twitter.com/xaprb) may give us nightmares [[read it](http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20it%27s%20Like%3A%20An%20Ignite%20talk%20on%20being%20a%20founder/CEO%20by%20%40xaprb%20http%3A//bit.ly/1MQveSa%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway? If you have to write a talk in a hurry, go back to your core values and choose something that you know really well.  

Does your talk touch on subjects that might be upsetting to some people? [@rem](https://twitter.com/rem) explains why you should think about including a content warning [[read it](https://remysharp.com/2015/11/27/content-warnings)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Content%20warnings%3A%20Why%20you%20should%20think%20about%20including%20one%20in%20your%20talk%20by%20%40rem%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OzX1a4%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

Nice write up of the USENIX Release Engineering Summit by [@kmoir](https://twitter.com/kmoir) [[read it](http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.ca/2015/11/usenix-release-engineering-summit-2015.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=USENIX%20Release%20Engineering%20Summit%202015%20recap%20by%20%40kmoir%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Xs3Emy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite bit was Kim’s explanation of what pre-reading and watching she did to prepare her talk.  

[@precisememory](https://twitter.com/precisememory) wrote about a less than stellar experience at a hackathon, and how “diversity” doesn’t always mean “inclusivity” [[read it](https://medium.com/@precisememory/the-event-was-a-great-success-bc7cfd0418a0#.hkwoh0tbl)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Diversity%20in%20hackathons%3A%20A%20lesson%20in%20inclusivity%20by%20%40precisememory%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OOYBFf)]. Key quote, “And if diversity in tech groups aren’t there for their community, and are leaving people like me out, then their efforts ring hollow. I want real inclusivity in the tech world, and I want to spend my efforts somewhere that I think wants that as a top priority, not just as a benefit or a side effect of raising awareness or money.”  

Cate wrote up the process that we followed running our anniversary mentoring program [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/07/running-a-mentoring-program/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Running%20a%20mentoring%20program%20-%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/07/running-a-mentoring-program/%20/by%20%40catehstn%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The main thing that we thought a lot about was setting expectations - for both mentors and mentees, and this covers why and how we went about doing that.  

## Inspiration  

Live demos are hard. But the Android Tools teams pulled off an hour of non-stop demos with 6 presenters! How? Byond lots of practice, they also have a nice tag flow: while one person present, the next speaker is on stage getting the second laptop ready, opening the correct files and programs, so the hand-offs are quick and smooth [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2GC6P5hPeA)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Fluid%20live%20demos%20by%20having%20two%20laptops%20on%20stage%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2GC6P5hPeA)].
