# Edition 57

LAST CALL for our December webinar on Dec 18 with [@mindweather](https://twitter.com/mindweather) where we will be talking about deeper learning from failure and success, with special guest co-host [@KellyShuster](https://twitter.com/KellyShuster) [[sign up](http://goo.gl/forms/NYRQ98HM19)]. Dave is the head of engineering at Pandora's Next Big Sound, and recently published [Beyond Blame](http://bit.ly/beyondblame) which uncovers some of the most powerful short-circuits to learning (blame and biases) and ways to overcome them.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

We don’t have a sponsor this week so we figured it was a nice time to tell y’all about some of our projects! Cate just launched her iOS app Show & Hide, it makes cool, partially colored images [[about](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/09/launching-show-hide/)][[buy it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/show-hide/id950349795?ls=1&mt=8)]. Chiu-Ki recently released leaderboard & achievements for Fit Cat, her adorable Android pedometer app & watchface [[about](http://blog.sqisland.com/search/label/fitcat)][[buy it](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sqisland.fitcat)].  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from over the Atlantic Ocean, where Chiu-Ki is flying to France for the holidays, and Seattle where Cate is hanging out [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge).  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**

## Link Roundup  

How do you write a pitch? [@danshapiro](https://twitter.com/danshapiro) explains: using a pyramid [[read it](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/09/pyramid-pitching/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Pyramid%20Pitching%20by%20%40danshapiro%20http%3A//bit.ly/1XCDisQ%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Most important aspect of the pyramid pitch: “If you stop at any point, they walk away with a solid idea of what you’re doing.” We can think of other places where this would be useful, too.  

Do you ever go to an event hoping to meet people only to spend all your time with people you know? Apparently you’re not alone [[read it](https://hbr.org/2015/12/succeed-in-new-situations)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Succeed%20in%20New%20Situations%3A%20Tips%20for%20introducing%20yourself%20and%20remembering%20names%20by%20%40keithrollag%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OzVdOy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] and this article has some helpful tips for introducing yourself and remembering names.  

We often hear the same reasons why people have not given a talk yet, and this article from [@standardista](https://twitter.com/standardista) debunks them all [[read it](http://www.standardista.com/speaking-at-conferences/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=You%20have%20to%20ask%20to%20get%20a%20%22yes%22%3A%20The%20first%20step%20to%20speak%20at%20a%20conference%20by%20%40standardista%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1LXC6cJ)]. Key takeaway: don’t pre-emptively reject yourself! ASK!  

Cate wrote about moderating her first panel [@beyondthecode15](https://twitter.com/beyondthecode15) [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/14/moderating-my-first-panel)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Moderating%20my%20first%20panel%20by%20%40catehstn%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Nje0gs%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. She wrote about taking an engineers approach to interrupting - because she didn’t want to interrupt panelists, she worked to ensure that interrupting wasn’t necessary.  

We love to hear about what people have been getting out of events so we appreciated this post from [@femgineer](https://twitter.com/femgineer) on what she’s learned from speaking internationally this year [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2015/12/what-ive-learned-from-speakers-around-the-world/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Learned%20from%20Speakers%20Around%20the%20World%20by%20%40femgineer%20http%3A//bit.ly/1NXzMUk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

## Inspiration  

This week we are inspired by all the people who set their public speaking goals as part of our anniversary. We particuarly loved it when people wrote a retrospective of their 2015 speaking!
