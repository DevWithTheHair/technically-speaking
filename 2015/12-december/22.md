# Edition 58

This will be the last issue of 2015! What a year! Thanks for being such a big part of it for us, and we’re looking forward to hearing about (and seeing!) y’all rock the stage in 2016.  

Thanks everyone who joined us for our December webinar with [@mindweather](https://twitter.com/mindweather) where we talked about deeper learning from failure and success, with special guest co-host [@KellyShuster](https://twitter.com/KellyShuster) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFco0NfEMc8)]. If you enjoyed the webinar, Dave’s book [Beyond Blame](http://bit.ly/beyondblame) uncovers some of the most powerful short-circuits to learning (blame and biases) and ways to overcome them.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

We don’t have a sponsor this week so we will continue to tell you about our projects! Fun Technically Speaking fact - both of us are very into testing. Chiu-Ki on Android, and Cate on iOS, and we’ve both developed content on how to architect and test your mobile applications! Chiu-Ki’s has a video course on Testing SharedPreferences with Dagger and Espresso [[more info](https://gumroad.com/l/AndroidTestSharedPref)], and Cate has an in-depth pdf on testing iOS applications [[more info](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/04/15/launching-ios-unit-testing-beyond-the-model/)].  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from France, where Chiu-Ki is spending the holidays, and Seattle where Cate is hanging out [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge).  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)]. We’re currently booking for Jan 12 onwards.**  

Our upcoming talks: Both in Tokyo! Chiu-Ki is speaking at [DroidKaigi](https://droidkaigi.github.io/2016/) in Tokyo in February.

*"The Lead Developer was probably the best-run conference I spoke at in 2015, with a highly-engaged audience eager to learn about what makes a great technical lead. If you have something to teach budding leaders, whether it is technical, process, or people-oriented, this is a great conference to apply to." ~[@skamille](https://twitter.com/skamille)*  

## Link Roundup  

We did an interview with [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) for The Eloquent Woman blog [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2015/12/interview-editors-of-techspeakdigest-on.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Interview%3A%20Editors%20of%20%40techspeakdigest%20on%20women%20speakers%20in%20tech%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OG5i9W)]. We talked a bit about how Technically Speaking got started, and what we’ve learned running it.  

Chiu-Ki wrote up a process for recording your own talk [[read it](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/12/use-quicktime-to-record-your-own-talk.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Use%20Quicktime%20to%20record%20your%20own%20talk%20by%20%40chiuki%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OG6f25)]. A lot of events do record, but not all, and some paywall the content, so this is a way to take back ownership and control!  

[@femgineer](https://twitter.com/femgineer) and [@kecatlin](https://twitter.com/kecatlin) shared an extract from their book of common mistakes presenters make [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2015/12/the-most-common-mistakes-presenters-make/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Most%20Common%20Mistakes%20Presenters%20Make%20by%20%40femgineer%20%26%20%40kecatlin%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Zl7viF)]. Of course the classic “reading text off slides” makes an appearance!  

[@margaretmz](https://twitter.com/margaretmz) wrote up her experience giving her first conference talk [[read it](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/my-fist-conference-talk-5b00975be8e2)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20First%20Conference%20Talk%20by%20%40margaretmz%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Pg4w6l)]. We particularly love the process she took to deciding what to speak about - finding a topic she knew a lot about, which she also knew many developers struggled with.  

[@DrKatHolt](https://twitter.com/DrKatHolt) analysed the gender break down of science conferences in Australia [[read it](https://sites.google.com/site/aussiescience/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Gender%20balance%20in%20scientific%20conferences%20(Australia)%20by%20%40DrKatHolt%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OhG94V)]. We were encouraged to see the trend of more invited talks by women.
