## Link Roundup

We've been watching the US election in horror, but one unexpected benefit has been the great content for women when dealing with obnoxious bullies and gendered language! This article (featuring [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) and [@CarolineGoyder](http://twitter.com/CarolineGoyder)) on how to beat a bully in a debate is full of helpful tips [[read it](http://qz.com/790454/a-strategy-to-help-hillary-clinton-beat-donald-trump-in-the-debates-can-also-help-you-defeat-the-office-bully/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20beat%20a%20bully%20in%20a%20debate%20%28Hillary%20Clinton,%20take%20note%29%20http%3A//qz.com/790454/a-strategy-to-help-hillary-clinton-beat-donald-trump-in-the-debates-can-also-help-you-defeat-the-office-bully%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite tip is one from Denise, draw attention to the behaviour without being pulled into it with a simple comment - "there you go again".

Sobering read from Nancy Householder Hauge on displaying emotion when speaking [[read it](http://consultingadultblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/speaking-as-woman.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Consulting%20Adult%3A%20Speaking%20as%20a%20Woman%20http%3A//consultingadultblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/speaking-as-woman.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "I have controlled my emotions for so long that appropriate displays of emotion, those others expect and accept in themselves, have become moments of fear and humiliation for me.  I am always worried that if I show any feelings I will be perceived as weak, puny, unreliable, girly, lacking in gravitas."

Many tech events still revolve around alcohol, but here are some useful scripts if you don't want to drink [[read it](https://captainawkward.com/2016/09/26/905-im-a-college-student-who-doesnt-drink-how-can-i-make-my-peers-understand-that-without-killing-the-mood/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20can%20I%20make%20my%20peers%20understand%20that%20I%20don't%20drink%20without%20killing%20the%20mood%20https%3A//captainawkward.com/2016/09/26/905-im-a-college-student-who-doesnt-drink-how-can-i-make-my-peers-understand-that-without-killing-the-mood/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Important point: if someone is pressuring you to drink, it's not you making the situation awkward - it's them.

We love this post from [@beerops](http://twitter.com/beerops) on giving and receiving feedback [[read it](https://beero.ps/2016/09/26/on-giving-and-receiving-feedback/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20Giving%20and%20Receiving%20Feedback%20by%20%40beerops%20https%3A//beero.ps/2016/09/26/on-giving-and-receiving-feedback/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and this point is so important: "The feedback you get from a coworker you know who is probably trying to help you grow and succeed is not the same as the feedback you get from some rando on Twitter."

Do you power pose before your talks? One of the researchers behind the original paper has come forward to say that she does not believe in their efficacy [[read it](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Power%20Poses%20Co-author%3A%20I%20Don%27t%20Think%20Power%20Poses%20Are%20Real%20by%20%40jessesingal%20http%3A//nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this on point [@HillaryClinton](http://twitter.com/HillaryClinton) quote from last night's debate [[watch it](https://twitter.com/politico/status/780589215054790656)]. "I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did.” YOU GO LADY! We do our homework too.
