## Link Roundup

Sobering read from Nancy Householder Hauge on displaying emotion when speaking [[read it](http://consultingadultblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/speaking-as-woman.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I have controlled my emotions for so long that appropriate displays of emotion, those others expect and accept in themselves, have become moments of fear and humiliation for me.  I am always worried that if I show any feelings I will be perceived as weak, puny, unreliable, girly, lacking in gravitas."
