## Link Roundup

Sobering read from Nancy Householder Hauge on displaying emotion when speaking [[read it](http://consultingadultblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/speaking-as-woman.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I have controlled my emotions for so long that appropriate displays of emotion, those others expect and accept in themselves, have become moments of fear and humiliation for me.  I am always worried that if I show any feelings I will be perceived as weak, puny, unreliable, girly, lacking in gravitas."

We've been watching the US election in horror, but one unexpected benefit has been the great content for women when dealing with obnoxious bullies and gendered language! This article (featuring [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) and [@CarolineGoyder](http://twitter.com/CarolineGoyder)) on how to beat a bully in a debate is full of helpful tips [[read it](http://qz.com/790454/a-strategy-to-help-hillary-clinton-beat-donald-trump-in-the-debates-can-also-help-you-defeat-the-office-bully/)][tweet it]. Our favourite tip is one from Denise, draw attention to the behaviour without being pulled into it with a simple comment - "there you go again".
