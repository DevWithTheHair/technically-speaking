## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) takes on the problem of presenting in your second langauge [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/09/help-im-not-as-eloquent-in-my-second.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "So, ask yourself: What is your first language like? What are the qualities that you think makes it eloquent? Then do the same for the new language in which you need to speak."

Cate wrote about her first MC experience at Try!Swift [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/09/06/mc-ing-tryswift-nyc/)][tweet it]. She shares three components of being an MC: 1. Make transitions smooth. 2. Make the audience feel welcome. 3. Make speakers feel comfortable.

Insightful article by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on the kind of criticism women face on their appearance when they run for office [[read it](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/campaign-stops/what-should-a-powerful-woman-look-like.html?_r=0)][tweet it]. Key quote, "The first feature article on me after I was elected lieutenant governor of Maryland criticized me for not wearing rouge (in reality it was there, just faded); the second one castigated me for wearing flats." - how many women in tech have we seen critiqued or praised based on their appearance?
