## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) takes on the problem of presenting in your second langauge [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/09/help-im-not-as-eloquent-in-my-second.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "So, ask yourself: What is your first language like? What are the qualities that you think makes it eloquent? Then do the same for the new language in which you need to speak."
