## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) takes on the problem of presenting in your second langauge [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/09/help-im-not-as-eloquent-in-my-second.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "So, ask yourself: What is your first language like? What are the qualities that you think makes it eloquent? Then do the same for the new language in which you need to speak."

Cate wrote about her first MC experience at Try!Swift [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/09/06/mc-ing-tryswift-nyc/)][tweet it]. She shares three components of being an MC: 1. Make transitions smooth. 2. Make the audience feel welcome. 3. Make speakers feel comfortable.

Insightful article by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on the kind of criticism women face on their appearance when they run for office [[read it](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/campaign-stops/what-should-a-powerful-woman-look-like.html?_r=0)][tweet it]. Key quote, "The first feature article on me after I was elected lieutenant governor of Maryland criticized me for not wearing rouge (in reality it was there, just faded); the second one castigated me for wearing flats." - how many women in tech have we seen critiqued or praised based on their appearance? 

We have been loving [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall)'s getting started in public speaking series! Step 4, on crafting proposals, is now up [[read it](https://medium.com/@cattsmall/how-to-become-a-public-speaker-in-1-year-step-4-the-proposal-bfec82cd4244#.z98wajpvd)][tweet it]. Great example of a successful proposal that was accepted, and another that was unsuccessful, and some insight into why.

## Inspiration

We are always inspired by people who speak truth to power, so we appreciated these two accounts from people who walked out of Lional Shriver's keynote at the Brisbane Writer's Festival. [@yassmin_a](http://twitter.com/yassmin_a) walked out and describes her experience doing so [[read it](https://medium.com/@yassmin_a/i-walked-out-of-the-brisbane-writers-festival-keynote-address-this-is-why-78a4d8c4b7ac#.s5n05hx57)][tweet it], and also has some choice comments on cultural appropriation, "But there is a bigger and broader issue, one that, for me, is more emotive. Cultural appropriation is a “thing”, because of our histories. The history of colonisation, where everything was taken from a people, the world over. Land, wealth, dignity… and now identity is to be taken as well?"

[@inexorablist](http://twitter.com/inexorablist) writes about the distinction between dangerous and subversive ideas [[read it](http://inexorablist.com/dangerous-ideas/)][tweet it]. "Shriver covered her musings with humour (which was admittedly only humorous to those who agreed with her), and under the guise of their being dangerous ideas. But as far as I’m concerned, it is unfair and enabling to call harmful ideas ‘dangerous’. As I wrote on Twitter, it’s similar to Andrew Bolt’s presence at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas that recently took place in Sydney. The ideas that he espouses, those of racism and bigotry, are becoming alarmingly prevalent in both Australian and global society, and they are truly dangerous. Dangerous in the sense that it may incite violence against others, or heavens forbid, violence against oneself. Dangerous is too often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for ‘subversive’, or ‘a challenging of the dominant discourse’ – things that we so desperately need."
