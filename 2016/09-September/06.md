# Edition 92

This week we have something of a theme of event writeups, and the little details from conference organizers that make all the difference to anxious speakers!

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Medellín, Colombia - where Cate was a last minute addition to the [@RubyConfCo](http://twitter.com/RubyConfCo) line up!

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote something about the workshops we gave in San Francisco and Denver, which includes some thoughts on co-presenting when we have very different styles [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/08/23/technically-speaking-workshops/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Technically%20Speaking%20Workshops%20by%20%40catehstn%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/08/23/technically-speaking-workshops/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We are so excited that two of our attendees [already had talks accepted](https://twitter.com/JillWetzler/status/771028402925031424)!

We love this post from [@CrystalMHuff](http://twitter.com/CrystalMHuff) on her experience at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/TheLeadDev). Great discussion of handling technical difficulties, and kudos on cutting down a 2-3 hour workshop to a 30 minute talk at 48 hours notice! [[read it](https://crystalhuff.com/2016/09/05/the-lead-developer-2016-uk/)[[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Speaking%20at%20%40TheLeadDev%20by%20%40CrystalMHuff%20https%3A//crystalhuff.com/2016/09/05/the-lead-developer-2016-uk/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Beautiful post from [@cocoaphony](http://twitter.com/cocoaphony) on [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) and on copying [[read it](http://robnapier.net/copying)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20Copying%20and%20%40tryswiftnyc%20by%20%40cocoaphony%20http%3A//robnapier.net/copying%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Lovely write up on [@hackandtell](http://twitter.com/hackandtell)'s most recent event [[read it](https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup/blob/master/nyc/round-38-wrapup.md)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Round%2038%20by%20%40hackandtell%20https%3A//github.com/hackandtell/wrapup/blob/master/nyc/round-38-wrapup.md%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] - some great examples of what kind of projects can be covered in a 5 minute talk!

If you've been following the latest controversy about $problematicDude and $conference, or even if you haven't, this thread by [@captainsafia](http://twitter.com/captainsafia) is worthwhile [[read it](https://twitter.com/captainsafia/status/771876719342956544)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Controversy%20at%20a%20recent%20conference%20by%20%40captainsafia%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//twitter.com/captainsafia/status/771876719342956544)]. Our favourite point was that the people most vocally angry tend to be commentators - who contribute nothing useful back to the community themselves.

## Inspiration

We love this talk on Become a Better Engineer Through Writing by [@kristinathai](https://twitter.com/kristinathai). She offers concrete tips on how to hone your communication skills by writing, which is a great springboard for speaking: it crystallizes your thoughts and also associates you with a topic [[watch it](https://realm.io/news/altconf-kristina-thai-better-engineer-through-writing/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Become%20a%20Better%20Engineer%20Through%20Writing%20by%20%40kristinathai%20https%3A//realm.io/news/altconf-kristina-thai-better-engineer-through-writing/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
