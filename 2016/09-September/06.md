# Edition 92

This week we have something of a theme of event writeups, and the little details from conference organizers that make all the difference to anxious speakers!

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Medellín, Colombia - where Cate was a last minute addition to the [@RubyConfCo](http://twitter.com/RubyConfCo) line up!

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**  

*Technically Speaking is Open Source, which means you can find everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/) and you can also [submit issues](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/new) with CfPs and content!*

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote something about the workshops we gave in San Francisco and Denver, which includes some thoughts on co-presenting when we have very different styles [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/08/23/technically-speaking-workshops/)][tweet it]. We are so excited that two of our attendees [already had talks accepted](https://twitter.com/JillWetzler/status/771028402925031424)!

We love this post from [@CrystalMHuff](http://twitter.com/CrystalMHuff) on her experience at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/TheLeadDev). Great discussion of handling technical difficulties, and kudos on cutting down a 2-3 hour workshop to a 30 minute talk at 48 hours notice!

Beautiful post from [@cocoaphony](http://twitter.com/cocoaphony) on [@tryswiftnyc](http://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) and on copying [[read it](http://robnapier.net/copying)][tweet it].

Lovely write up on [@hackandtell](http://twitter.com/hackandtell)'s most recent event [[read it](https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup/blob/master/nyc/round-38-wrapup.md)][tweet it] - some great examples of what kind of projects can be covered in a 5 minute talk!

If you've been following the latest controversy about $problematicDude and $conference, or even if you haven't, this thread by [@captainsafia](http://twitter.com/captainsafia) is worthwhile [[read it](https://twitter.com/captainsafia/status/771876719342956544)]. Our favourite point was that the people most vocally angry tend to be commentators - who contribute nothing useful back to the community themselves.
