# Edition 92

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Medellín, Colombia - where Cate was a last minute addition to the [@RubyConfCo](http://twitter.com/RubyConfCo) line up!

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote something about the workshops we gave in San Francisco and Denver, which includes some thoughts on co-presenting when we have very different styles [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/08/23/technically-speaking-workshops/)][tweet it]. We are so excited that two of our attendees [already had talks accepted](https://twitter.com/JillWetzler/status/771028402925031424)!
