## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) rounds up some first time panel moderator experiences - including Cate's [[read it](http://www.moderatingpanels.com/2016/09/first-time-panel-moderators-share.html)][tweet it]! We really loved [@yashvprabhu](http://twitter.com/yashvprabhu)'s writeup of running an Android panel and [@MendeleyStack](http://twitter.com/MendeleyStack) pre-panel thoughts (written on a plane!) on running a panel on microservices.

[@philsturgeon](http://twitter.com/philsturgeon) takes on codes of conduct and their opposition - mainly in OSS communities [[read it](https://philsturgeon.uk/2016/09/15/codes-of-conduct-maybe-theyre-not-so-bad/)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I've never once heard of a falsy accused person being given any level of crap by an imagined claim, using a Code of Conduct as the basis for that persons bad day. I have heard of a million and one stories of women and margionalized groups being given all sorts of shit on an almost daily basis, and have heard of plenty of people saying "I'm not getting involved in that community, it's full of assholes.""

We think that writing and speaking go hand in hand, so we loved this post from [@annashipman](http://twitter.com/annashipman) on how to blog [[read it](http://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/how-to-blog.html)][tweet it]. Key takeaway - figure out what works for you, and JFDI!

Fascinating - and depressing - article about the voice itself as a source of unconscious bias [[read it](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063218/how-unconscious-bias-is-affecting-our-ability-to-listen)][tweet it]. If someone says the word "academy" do you think of a school or an awards show? That might just depend on who says it...

We're enthusiastically backing this Kickstarter campaign for a Responsible Communication Style Guide from [@recompilermag](http://twitter.com/recompilermag) [[read it](https://recompilermag.com/2016/09/06/introducing-the-responsible-communication-style-guide/)][tweet it]. It's a book on inclusive writing and technology, and we know our presentations will be better for it!
