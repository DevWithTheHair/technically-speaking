## Link Roundup  

We love people’s reminiscences about their first ever public talk, especially from seasoned speakers, so we love that [@poornima](https://twitter.com/poornima) shared hers [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2016/04/why-you-dont-need-to-be-an-expert-to-speak/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20You%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Need%20To%20Be%20An%20Expert%20To%20Speak%20-%20http%3A//femgineer.com/2016/04/why-you-dont-need-to-be-an-expert-to-speak/%20/by%20%40poornima%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We couldn’t agree more with the message that you don’t need to hold yourself to some standard of “expert” in order to have a talk worth giving.  

If you’re wanting to get more speaking engagements and thinking about engaging in a little self-promotion, this list from [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on things to include on your speaker page could be helpful [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/03/smart-self-promotion-6-must-haves-on.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Smart%20self-promotion%3A%206%20must-haves%20on%20your%20speaker%20page%20-%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/03/smart-self-promotion-6-must-haves-on.html%20/by%20%40dontgetcaught%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]! Now we need to go rework our websites…  

If you need to make a slide deck but aren’t sure where to begin, [@alicebartlett](https://twitter.com/alicebartlett) has you covered with this white-labelled slide deck [[read it](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20white-label%20slide%20deck%20-%20http%3A//alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides%20/by%20%40alicebartlett%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Bonus: useful explanations of which slide to use and why.  

Cate wrote up her process for preparing for a podcast and a bit about the Less Than Or Equal episode released in March [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/12/talking-shine-theory-and-other-things-on-ltoe/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Talking%20Shine%20Theory%20and%20Other%20Things%20on%20%40lessthanorequal%20-%20http%3A//buff.ly/22DYzol%20/by%20%40catehstn%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Even if the host says preparation isn’t necessary, it’s worth listening to some previous episodes to get a sense of what the podcast is like!  

The conference organization less obvious checklist has had a massive update, and is a must-read for any conference organizer put together by [@erikpub](https://twitter.com/erikpub) [[read it](https://github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Less%20Obvious%20Conference%20Checklist%20-%20https%3A//github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist%20/by%20%40erikpub%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lots of great points, but this one jumped out “Consider the diversity of your speakers, particularly your keynote speakers, and the message that sends to (potential) conference attendees.”  

## Inspiration  

We’re inspired by [@jsconfco](https://twitter.com/jsconfco) who announced their speaker line up - of all (amazing!) women. It’s great to see years of work on inclusivity pay off. [Their CfP opens today](http://jsconf.co/).
