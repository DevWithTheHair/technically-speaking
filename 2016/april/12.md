# Edition 72

Hello! Can you believe that we’ve been going for 18 months? We’re surprised and proud and thankful that we have been able to share this journey with so many of you. We’ve watched our subscriber count grow since even before we sent out the first issue from Sweden, but best of all we’ve seen so many of you on stage around the world! Thanks for reading, and sharing. We’re watching some trashfires burn in the conference sphere this week, but we like to believe that here we have a welcoming space where we cheer each other on. So, we’ve put together an optimistic edition as a palette cleanser! And, we’ll keep being your mentor in your inbox each week, trying to remind you - yes you! - that you have something to say.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@TestDouble](https://twitter.com/testdouble/)! Software is broken, we are working hard to fix it. We’re looking for others to help us improve the lives of developers and users alike.  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colombia and Colorado - we are both “home”.  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**

## Link Roundup  

We adore that [@lara_hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan) live tweeted her day giving a conference talk [[read it](https://storify.com/larahogan/day-of-talk-countdown)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day-of-talk%20countdown%3A%20Live%20tweets%20from%20%40lara_hogan%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//storify.com/larahogan/day-of-talk-countdown)]. Even experienced, well-prepared presenters get nervous. Pre-talk rituals help, and we really appreciate Lara giving us a glimpse into hers.  

Great article by [@kecatlin](https://twitter.com/kecatlin) on why your talk will be more compelling if you start it with a story [[read it](https://medium.com/@anitaborg_org/start-with-a-story-f59664546313#.t3mi518c9)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Start%20With%20A%20Story%3A%20Make%20your%20talk%20more%20compelling%20by%20%40kecatlin%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/23z4TQu)]. Also wonderful: all the photos in this post come from [@wocintechchat](https://twitter.com/wocintechchat)!  

We cannot tell you how much we love this speaker acceptance email from [@bridgetkromhout](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout) for [@devopsdaysmsp](https://twitter.com/devopsdaysmsp) [[read it](http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2016/04/06/tl-dr-your-talk-is-accepted/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tl;dr%3A%20Your%20Talk%20Is%20Accepted%20by%20%40bridgetkromhout%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1VOUzkO)]. We’ve read our share of speaker acceptance emails, and it’s rare they are so thorough.  

This article on why women’s organizations should pay their speakers gave us a lot to think about [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/womens-professional-organizations-sister-up-pay-your-speakers-gates)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Women%27s%20Professional%20Organizations%3A%20Sister%20Up%20and%20Pay%20Your%20Speakers%20by%20%40LisaGates1%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1VkdIwp)]. Key quote, “If women’s organizations aren’t paying their speakers, their actions don’t square with their missions. We need our organizations to model at the level of our pocketbooks that what we do for a living is not only worth money, but a sustainable plank in one’s platform for business success.”  

Helpful look behind the scenes from a reviewer of [@keeprubyweird](http://keeprubyweird.com/), [@schneems](https://twitter.com/schneems) [[read it](http://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Get%20Your%20Conference%20Proposal%20Accepted%20by%20%40schneems%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal/)]. There’s a lot covered here, but most helpful is what reviewers are looking for, and how to catch their attention.  

## Inspiration  

We have discovered the meaning of “lolsob” and it’s this video of Jimmy Kimmel mansplaining mansplaining to Hillary Clinton [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2wBpYT6Zlo)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Jimmy%20Kimmel%20mansplaining%20mansplaining%20to%20%40HillaryClinton%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//youtu.be/j2wBpYT6Zlo)]. We hope we can handle our next mansplainer with such grace…
