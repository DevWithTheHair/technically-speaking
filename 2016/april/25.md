## Link Roundup

Great list by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) of things speakers hide behind [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/04/6-things-you-might-be-hiding-behind-as.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=6%20things%20you%20might%20be%20hiding%20behind%20as%20a%20public%20speaker%20-%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/04/6-things-you-might-be-hiding-behind-as.html%20/by%20%40dontgetcaught%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and this bit on public disclaimers jumped out at us, “You're in effect giving yourself permission to not be perfect or telling the audience not to judge you, out loud. Try saying these things to yourself, but not the audience, next time. They're not adding to your image or your talk.”

Look at the conference organizers page for this computer vision conference [[read it](http://cvpr2016.thecvf.com/organizers)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=CVPR%202016%20People%20-%20http%3A//cvpr2016.thecvf.com/organizers%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Just look at it.

[@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew) is running a survey about conference speaking experiences as part of her preparation for a talk [[read it](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/conference-speaking)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20Speaking%20Survey%20-%20https%3A//www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/conference-speaking%20/by%20%40rachelandrew%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We can't wait to see the results!

TED talks, with their focus on storytelling, and online availability have massively influenced conferences and speakers alike, Seth Godin reminisces about some that he gave, his favourites and why [[read it](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/04/the-truth-about-my-ted-talks.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Treating%20your%20talk%20as%20a%20gift%20-%20http%3A//sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/04/the-truth-about-my-ted-talks.html%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The title of the post frames a talk as a gift, a point which we wish he explored more in the text.

We're happy to see [@AltConference](http://twitter.com/altconference) being accountable for past code of conduct issues and being public about a plan to do better [[read it](http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=3139e22dc9&id=053167896f)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Getting%20Better%20-%20http%3A//us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=3139e22dc9%26id=053167896f%20/by%20%40altconference%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

Our inspiration this week is [@ThatBettina](http://twitter.com/ThatBettina) who sent us [this picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEZKi9iBYuT/) of herself wearing a Technically Speaking tshirt and told us "Your tshirt reminded me to keep going through the hard parts of speech writing because I really had something unique to say and I needed to share it." We love it, and hope that it inspires you to find your unique thing to say, also.
