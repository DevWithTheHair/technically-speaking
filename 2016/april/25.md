## Link Roundup

Great list by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) of things speakers hide behind [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/04/6-things-you-might-be-hiding-behind-as.html)][tweet it], and this bit on public disclaimers jumped out at us, “You're in effect giving yourself permission to not be perfect or telling the audience not to judge you, out loud. Try saying these things to yourself, but not the audience, next time. They're not adding to your image or your talk.”

Look at the conference organizers page for this computer vision conference [[read it](http://cvpr2016.thecvf.com/organizers)][tweet it]. Just look at it.
