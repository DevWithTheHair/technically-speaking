## Link Roundup  

[@sarahsharp](https://twitter.com/sarahsharp) wrote about how the text of a Code of Conduct is the least of what needs to happen to create an inclusive environment [[read it](http://sarah.thesharps.us/2016/01/25/code-of-conducts-warning-signs/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Warning%20Signs%20by%20%40sarahsharp%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1NHSDSP)]. We love the metaphor of a CoC as a “No Trespassing” sign.  

We adore [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught)’s Famous Speech Friday write up of [@IAMQUEENLATIFAH](https://twitter.com/IAMQUEENLATIFAH)’s acceptance - accept with strength, in contrast to the self-deprecating comments so many women feel the need to respond to achievements and complements with [[read it](http://bit.ly/1TOaZZK)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Famous%20Speech%20Friday%3A%20%40IAMQUEENLATIFAH%27s%20%22Keep%20fighting%20for%20it%22%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/1TOaZZK%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

A look behind the scenes of a CfP acceptance process at php[architect] by [@EliW](https://twitter.com/EliW) [[read it](https://www.phparch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Buidling_a_Conference_Schedule-phparchitect-February2016.pdf)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20look%20behind%20the%20scenes%20of%20a%20CfP%20acceptance%20process%20at%20php%5Barchitect%5D%20by%20%40EliW%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Q588vQ%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway “Selection is based on so many factors as to be mind-boggling”.  

[@Lindsay_Henry](https://twitter.com/Lindsay_Henry) wrote a beautiful meditation on fear of asking questions [[read it](http://amysmartgirls.com/got-a-question-raise-your-hand/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Got%20a%20question?%20Raise%20your%20hand%20by%20%40Lindsay_Henry%20http%3A//bit.ly/23SMI9m%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, “In seeing the eagerness of the younger students compared to the reluctance of myself and other adults to raise our hands, I wondered: When do we lose that fearlessness to ask the questions?”  

Cate wrote up her current policy on speaker travel costs [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/02/08/my-current-policy-on-speaker-travel-costs/)][[tweet it]](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20speaker%20travel%20costs%20and%20inclusivity%20-%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/02/08/my-current-policy-on-speaker-travel-costs/%20/by%20%40catehstn%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest). Key point: “I only want to speak at or be associated with events that make an effort for inclusivity, and I believe that travel costs are an inclusivity issue.”  

## Inspiration  

Same as - as far as we can make out - everyone, our inspiration this week is Beyonce, or Queen Bey. The powerful imagery and blunt lyrics in her latest video [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrCHz1gwzTo&feature=youtu.be)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Formation%20(Dirty)%0Aby%20%40Beyonce%20https%3A//youtu.be/LrCHz1gwzTo%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] make important points and set Twitter alight over the weekend.
