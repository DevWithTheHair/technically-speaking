## Link Roundup  

Some unexpected speaking tips for women from [@5050pledge](https://twitter.com/5050pledge) [[read it](http://www.5050pledge.com/unexpected-tips-for-women-speakers-from-women-who-own-the-stage/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Unexpected%20tips%20for%20women%20speakers,%20from%20women%20who%20own%20the%20stage%20by%20%405050pledge%20http%3A//bit.ly/1NZPWw5%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The problems with headset mics and women’s hair, or clip-on mic’s and flimsy clothing are real - it’s worth asking what kind of mic will be used.  

We love [@matthewwarren](https://twitter.com/matthewwarren)’s write up from our mentoring program last year [[read it](http://mattwarren.github.io/2016/02/16/technically-speaking-anniversary-mentoring/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Technically%20Speaking%20-%20Anniversary%20Mentoring%20by%20%40matthewwarren%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1UjJ0l4)]! Cate worked with him on improving his abstract, and you can see the before and after.  

Incredibly thorough write up from [@lrnrd](https://twitter.com/lrnrd) on how she prepares for a talk [[read it](http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2016/02/16/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-tech-conference-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20prepare%20and%20write%20a%20tech%20conference%20talk%20by%20%40lrnrd%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1WFy1kw)]. We particularly appreciated the section on nerves!  

Cate has been preparing a new talk and going through the normal spiral of doubt and excitement [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/02/15/my-process-for-writing-a-new-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20Process%20for%20Writing%20a%20New%20Talk%20by%20%40catehstn%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1KGdBas)].  

[@jsconfeu](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu) have lifted their recommendation not to attend JS Conf Beirut after concerns about one of the organizers were addressed [[read it](http://2015.jsconf.eu/news/2016/01/13/concerning-jsconf-beirut/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=UPDATED%3A%20Concerning%20JSConf%20Beirut%20by%20%40jsconfeu%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Pn37bs)]. This is how the code of conduct process is supposed to work, and it’s great to see that in action.  

## Inspiration  

We love this [@CodeNewbies](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) episode with[ @buritica](https://twitter.com/buritica) talking about building communities in Colombia and the challenges of remotely running a conference in a developing country [[listen](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/coding-in-columbia)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Coding%20In%20Colombia%20with%20%40buritica%20on%20%40CodeNewbies%20by%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1QXe9Fu)]. We’re inspired by the intentional choice of done this, what’s next? How do I scale?
