# Edition 62

This week we have how to analyse your video, risk mitigation when there’s not a proper Code of Conduct, and a great example of extracting the key points from a talk.  

[Last week](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak/letters/technically-speaking-jan-19-2016) Chiu-Ki got too excited about conferences in Colorado. While [GopherCon](http://cfp.gophercon.com/events/gc16) and [LambdaConf](http://lambdaconf.us/) are in Denver and Boulder respectively, [self.conference](http://selfconference.org/) is in Detroit rather than Denver. Sorry about that.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@femgineer](https://twitter.com/femgineer), [How to Transform Your Ideas into Software Products](http://femgineer.com/transform-ideas/): walks you through steps to create a product people will pay for!

*From [@piwai](https://twitter.com/piwai): I really enjoyed the MCE 2015 conference as a speaker. It's one of the best conference organization I have seen: volunteers waiting for you at the airport, 3G sim card gift, great speaker introductions on stage that led to warm applauses before starting. In 2015 they mixed dev & designer talks, which was interesting because it opened my horizons.*  

## Link Roundup  

Excellent write up of a amazing talk [@nellshamrell](https://twitter.com/nellshamrell) gave on surgical refactoring by [@billblondeau](https://twitter.com/billblondeau) [[read it](http://walrus.adorable.io/post/first-do-no-harm-surgical-refactoring/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=First%20Do%20No%20Harm%3A%20Surgical%20Refactoring%20by%20%40nellshamrell%20reviewed%20by%20%40billblondeau%20http%3A//bit.ly/1ZPb3bh%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Extracting the key takeaways from a talk given by someone else is a great way to retain what you learned.  

We were late to this post from 2013 by [@JennLukas](https://twitter.com/JennLukas) but were gripped from the tag line, “I wanted more women in tech on stage, so I started with myself” [[read it](https://medium.com/ladies-in-tech/convince-yourself-to-be-a-public-speaker-18cc519f38f7#.qhuzvvdeq)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Convince%20Yourself%20to%20be%20a%20Public%20Speaker%20by%20%40JennLukas%20http%3A//bit.ly/1JAcgl0%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, “I thought about that a lot. I thought about in conferences (and life in general) the person you are going to be able to convince the easiest to help you in your quest for anything, is yourself. I can help encourage more female speakers by being one. I can practice what I preach. I can do this. So I did.”  

Sadly there are still no videos of Cate on the internet but for everyone else there’s this post from [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/01/5-ways-you-can-analyze-your-speech-once.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=5%20ways%20you%20can%20analyze%20your%20speech%20once%20it%27s%20done%20(and%20how%20I%20do%20it)%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/200pm2g%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. 5 strategies to best analyse the video so you can learn from it.  

We are sad how often we find ourselves sharing things about events lacking codes of conduct (hello! it’s 2016!) but here’s a view from the other side: what if the event doesn’t have a code of conduct, and you decide to go anyway? [@brainwane](https://twitter.com/brainwane) explores risk mitigation [[read it](http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2016/01/21/0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Risk%20Mitigation%20by%20%40brainwane%20http%3A//bit.ly/1S7MMi3%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

To understand the trouble the OSS movement in particular has with Codes of Conduct, pair with this post from [@christi3k](https://twitter.com/christi3k) on the adoption of Codes of Conduct in FLOSS projects [[read it](https://subfictional.com/2016/01/25/the-complex-reality-of-adopting-a-meaningful-code-of-conduct/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20complex%20reality%20of%20adopting%20a%20meaningful%20code%20of%20conduct%20by%20%40christi3k%20http%3A//bit.ly/1nLWGbZ%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

## Inspiration  

Feel like you don’t want to give a talk because it’s not new? [@Kusand](https://twitter.com/Kusand) sent us this great comic to refute that [[read it](http://broodhollow.chainsawsuit.com/page/2016/01/18/cadavre-and-the-importance-of-again)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Cadavre%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20Again%20by%20%40broodhollow%20http%3A//bit.ly/1ZNxPQT%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20h/t%20%40Kusand)].
