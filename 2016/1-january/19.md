# Edition 61

This week we have a great flowchart on questions, some top posts from last year, tips on presenting and an example of organizers enforcing a code of conduct.  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@cognitect](https://twitter.com/cognitect?lang=en), who has [Opportunity Grants](http://clojurewest.org/opportunity.html) available for attending [Clojure/west](http://clojurewest.org/) in Seattle this April. Registration opens this week.  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from NYC, where Cate is (again) and Colorado where Chiu-Ki lives (still - with her snowboard! Yay winter!)  

We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].

*From [@aysylu22](https://twitter.com/aysylu22): I spoke at LambdaConf last year and really enjoyed my time at the conference learning from other speakers and discussing functional programming with friendly fellow attendees. The conference provides free day care for all attendees children. Talks cover a wide range of topics in functional and logic programming, as well as introduction to these topics for beginners. The conference takes place in the beautiful Boulder, during the weekend of Boulder Creek festival, which is a lot of fun. Accommodation is covered for speakers, travel is covered on a case by case basis.*

## Link Roundup  

[@jsconfeu](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu) have withdrawn their support for the conference formally known as JS Conf Beirut after multiple code of conduct violations were not addressed [[read it](http://2015.jsconf.eu/news/2016/01/13/concerning-jsconf-beirut/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Concerning%20JSConf%20Beirut%20by%20%40jsconfeu%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Pn37bs%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We think this is an important example of conference organizers holding other conference organizers accountable and commend [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl)  [@theophani](https://twitter.com/theophani) and the rest of the JSConfEU team. It’s been followed up by an open letter from the MENA-Devs community [[read it](https://github.com/mena-devs/open_letter)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Open%20Letter%20to%20the%20Global%20JSConf%20Community%20https%3A//github.com/mena-devs/open_letter%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

The Eloquent Woman is one of our favourite blogs on speaking, and [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) shared the top 10 posts (and guest posts!) for the year [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/01/tip-bonanza-top-10-posts-guest-posts-on.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tip%20bonanza%3A%20Top%2010%20posts%20%26%20guest%20posts%20on%20The%20Eloquent%20Woman%202015%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/1lpd1lc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Cate’s post about how she gets herself uninvited from unflattering speaking invitations was #3!  

[@blackurbanist](https://twitter.com/blackurbanist) shares some tips on presenting your work [[read it](http://theblackurbanist.com/six-things-to-do-when-you-present-your-work/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Six%20Things%20to%20Do%20When%20You%20Present%20Your%20Work%20by%20%40blackurbanist%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OChM3f%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. One of the most often overlooked is to read through the guidelines before you start designing your presentation.  

Questions seem to be one of the top fears of would-be speakers, so we love this flowchart on asking questions by [@anyharder](https://twitter.com/anyharder) [[read it](http://blog.annharter.com/2015/08/21/a-guide-to-talking.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20Guide%20to%20Talking,%20in%20flowchart%20form%20by%20%40anyharder%20http%3A//bit.ly/1SsTEWL%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and it comes with some good points on asking questions in general, “In my experience, good thoughtful questions enhance the experience of both speaker and audience. Speaking is hard, and a lot of people get very nervous while presenting. You shouldn’t let that prevent you from asking hard questions, but with a little thoughtfulness, you can do that without being a jerk. Bad questions have the possibility to derail everything, and the point of asking your question should not be that!”  

If you’re contemplating your first conference proposal and don’t know where to start, [@PyLadies](https://twitter.com/PyLadies) are hosting a remote webinar on Jan 30th that may help [[read it]](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/your-first-conference-proposal-tickets-20707409419)[[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Webinar%3A%20Your%20First%20Conference%20Proposal!%20on%20Jan%2030%20by%20%40PyLadies%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Je616e%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We have decided not to run webinars in 2016, so we are happy to see resources like this!  

## Inspiration  

Most of us spend 80% of our talk explaining the technology, and 20% at the end to demo. How about flipping it around? Spend 10% of your time setting up the scenario, and jump straight into your demo to wow the audience. Then, round it up in the last 10% with a summary of the technology. See a great example by [@purdybot](https://twitter.com/purdybot) and [@ThisIsJohnBrown](https://twitter.com/ThisIsJohnBrown) on interactive physical art, powered by JavaScript [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xYKEtocBjE)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Interactive%20Physical%20Installations%20Powered%20by%20JavaScript%20by%20%40purdybot%20%26%20%40ThisIsJohnBrown%20https%3A//youtu.be/0xYKEtocBjE%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
