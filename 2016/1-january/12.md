Wow so many CfPs are coming our way! Now is a great time to polish your abstract and figure out what you could talk about because so many great events are coming up! This issue we have curated three CfPs for you, as well as useful tips on “um”, a story of how to handle a code of conduct violation, and some dramatic and yet technical inspiration.

## Link Roundup  

If you worry about saying “um” perhaps this article by [@soldonlanguage](https://twitter.com/soldonlanguage) will help [[read it](http://nautil.us/blog/your-speech-is-packed-with-misunderstood-unconscious-messages)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Your%20Speech%20Is%20Packed%20With%20Misunderstood,%20Unconscious%20Messages%20by%20%40soldonlanguage%20http%3A//bit.ly/1RhlIfx%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway? Experts giving more accurate information have a greater number of “disfluencies” not less.  

[@sarahmei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei) was looking to expand her conference horizons outside of the Ruby community, and collected the results in a Storify [[read it](https://storify.com/sarahmei/expanding-my-conference-horizons)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Expanding%20Conference%20Horizons%20by%20%40sarahmei%20http%3A//bit.ly/1REY76Z%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. What conferences are unmissable for you in 2016? Tweet us [@techspeakdigest](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

We’re interested in this collection of UX conferences highlighting the gender breakdown and whether the conference has a code of conduct [[read it](http://www.usabilitycounts.com/events/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=UX%20Events%20Gender%20Breakdown%20and%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20by%20%40usabilitycounts%20http%3A//www.usabilitycounts.com/events/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We’d love to see someone running the data on the relationship between having a code of conduct and number of women speakers.  

How do you respond to a code of conduct violation? This post by [@lachlanhardy](https://twitter.com/lachlanhardy) is old but remains an excellent example [[read it](http://lachstock.com.au/articles/incident-report/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Incident%20Report%20by%20%40lachlanhardy%20http%3A//lachstock.com.au/articles/incident-report/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, “Nobody wants anything like this to happen at their events. Many event organisers specifically craft systems to try and avoid it. SydJS had been lucky. And our luck ran out. But associating this purely with luck denies the value of our community’s culture. A number of people tweeted their disapproval, or expressed it to me in person in the relatively short time before I apologised publicly. Many more have spoken to me since then to tell me how they felt at the time and how they felt about the apology.”  

We love the illustrations in this post about who can attend a conference depending on whether travel costs are covered [[read it](http://pewpewlaser.com/blogs/647)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Who%20Can%20Speak%20at%20Your%20Conference?%20by%20%40KatieK2%20http%3A//bit.ly/1ScsPGb%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and it makes an important point, “In fact, the lack of expense reimbursement tends to play a larger role in talk submissions for under-represented people than it does for those who are not.” - and this is why we always include what’s covered in Technically Speaking.  

## Inspiration  

At RubyConf 2015, [@nmeans](https://twitter.com/nmeans) tells the gripping story of an airplane crash. The story is amazing, and he did a great job in explaining the technical details to understand the story at appropriate times with diagrams and props. [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2FUSr3WlPk)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20Crash%20an%20Airplane%20by%20%40nmeans%20at%20%40rubyconf%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2FUSr3WlPk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
