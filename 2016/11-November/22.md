We had to lolsob when someone tweeted that things were so bad that millenials were actually making *phone calls*, but we're charmed by this step by step guide on dealing with social anxiety to do so by [@cordeliadillon](http://twitter.com/cordeliadillon) [[read it](http://echothroughthefog.cordeliadillon.com/post/153393286626/how-to-call-your-reps-when-you-have-social-anxiety)][tweet it].
