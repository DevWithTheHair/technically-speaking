## Link Roundup

[@FMuntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu) shares how she realizes that "what’s obvious and easy for you, might not be the same for others". We love the backstories for her various blog posts and talks [[read it](https://medium.com/upday-devs/tech-talks-you-do-have-something-to-say-a1a0ae23fa0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tech%20Talks%E2%80%8A%20-%20%E2%80%8AYou%20Do%20Have%20Something%20To%20Say!%0Aby%20%40FMuntenescu%20https%3A//medium.com/upday-devs/tech-talks-you-do-have-something-to-say-a1a0ae23fa0%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Need help with coming up talk ideas? [@mseckington](https://twitter.com/mseckington) has a list of questions that you can use as inspiration [[read it]( http://missgeeky.com/2016/11/21/how-to-brainstorm-talk-ideas)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20To%20Brainstorm%20Talk%20Ideas%20by%20%40mseckington%20http%3A//missgeeky.com/2016/11/21/how-to-brainstorm-talk-ideas%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

The next time we're anxious, we're going to try self compassion over self esteem [[read it](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/05/why-self-compassion-works-better-than-self-esteem/481473/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20Self-Compassion%20Works%20Better%20Than%20Self-Esteem%20by%20%40olgakhazan%20http%3A//www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/05/why-self-compassion-works-better-than-self-esteem/481473/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "What would I say to a close friend I cared about in this situation?" is such a good question to ask yourself when stressed - for example, before you give a talk.

We had to lolsob when someone tweeted that things were so bad that millenials were actually making *phone calls*, but we're charmed by this step by step guide on dealing with social anxiety to do so by [@cordeliadillon](http://twitter.com/cordeliadillon) [[read it](http://echothroughthefog.cordeliadillon.com/post/153393286626/how-to-call-your-reps-when-you-have-social-anxiety)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20call%20your%20reps%20when%20you%20have%20social%20anxiety%20by%20%40cordeliadillon%20http%3A//echothroughthefog.cordeliadillon.com/post/153393286626/how-to-call-your-reps-when-you-have-social-anxiety%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. What other terrifying speaking situations could it be useful for?

Some good points in this post by [@patkua](http://twitter.com/patkua) particuarly when it comes to a speaker's responsibility to consider how their presentation includes - or excludes - people in the audience [[read it](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2016/10/we-can-do-better/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=We%20can%20do%20better%20by%20%40patkua%20https%3A//www.thekua.com/atwork/2016/10/we-can-do-better/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

Code of Conduct is not just a document. It is a commitment to provide a safe space for everyone. We are really inspired by the transparency report from [@DjangoUnderHood](https://twitter.com/DjangoUnderHood)
[[read it](https://djangounderthehood.com/blog/article/2016-11-21-coc-transparency-report/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Transparency%20Report%20by%20%40DjangoUnderHood%20https%3A//djangounderthehood.com/blog/article/2016-11-21-coc-transparency-report/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It goes a long way to show the community that they take the Code of Conduct very seriously.
