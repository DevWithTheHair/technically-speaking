Speak Spanish? Know someone who does? Submissions are open for Char.la [[read it](http://char.la/propuesta)][tweet it].

We're charmed by this story of a first talk - and the unexpected benefits [[read it](http://dolcedesign.com/2015/07/09/the-chocolate-ripple-effect-of-public-speaking-at-wordcamp/)][tweet it] by [@belindadarcey](http://twitter.com/belindadarcey). Also contains some important lessons about candy as a weapon... 

How much of your alloted time should you fill? [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) explains the 15% rule [[read it](http://www.dontgetcaught.biz/2016/11/the-15-percent-less-rule-lifesaver-for.html)][tweet it]. 15% makes sure you don't go over time, but it also gives some flexibility for connecting with the audience when the time is right, too.

We love these posters on designing for accessibility [[read it](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)][tweet it]. The content is focused on user interfaces, but we think it's probably worth keeping in mind for your next slide deck, too.

Great write up from this year's &conf on what made it great and things to learn next year by one of the organizers [@lilliealbert](http://twitter.com/lilliealbert) [[read it](https://blog.andconf.io/andconf-2016-it-happened-ebe8e67386a#.a75btees2)][tweet it]. There's also a nice write up from attendee Devney Hamilton [[read it](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/09/13/andconf/)][tweet it].
