We're charmed by this story of a first talk - and the unexpected benefits [[read it](http://dolcedesign.com/2015/07/09/the-chocolate-ripple-effect-of-public-speaking-at-wordcamp/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20%28Chocolate%29%20Ripple%20Effect%20of%20Public%20Speaking%20by%20%40belindadarcey%20http%3A//dolcedesign.com/2015/07/09/the-chocolate-ripple-effect-of-public-speaking-at-wordcamp/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] by [@belindadarcey](http://twitter.com/belindadarcey).

How much of your alloted time should you fill? [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) explains the 15% rule [[read it](http://www.dontgetcaught.biz/2016/11/the-15-percent-less-rule-lifesaver-for.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%2015%20percent%20less%20rule%2C%20a%20lifesaver%20for%20speeches%20%26%20media%20interviews%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//www.dontgetcaught.biz/2016/11/the-15-percent-less-rule-lifesaver-for.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. 15% makes sure you don't go over time, but it also gives some flexibility for connecting with the audience when the time is right, too.

We love these posters on designing for accessibility [[read it](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Dos%20and%20don%27ts%20on%20designing%20for%20accessibility%20https%3A//accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The content is focused on user interfaces, but we think it's probably worth keeping in mind for your next slide deck, too.

Great write up from this year's &conf on what made it great and things to learn for next time by one of the organizers [@lilliealbert](http://twitter.com/lilliealbert) [[read it](https://blog.andconf.io/andconf-2016-it-happened-ebe8e67386a#.a75btees2)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=AndConf%202016%3A%20It%20Happened%20by%20%40lilliealbert%20%0Ahttps%3A//blog.andconf.io/andconf-2016-it-happened-ebe8e67386a%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. There's also a nice write up from attendee Devney Hamilton [[read it](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/09/13/andconf/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Rejuvenating%20My%20Developer%20Identity%20at%20AndConf%20by%20%40lilliealbert%20https%3A//spin.atomicobject.com/2016/09/13/andconf/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

When [@LuBellWoo](https://twitter.com/LuBellWoo) took off her necklace on stage at [@xoxo](https://twitter.com/xoxo), she was taking off her metaphorical armor. She bared herself to the world, showing us her struggles and vulnerbilities, and as a result made a deep connection with everyone [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLveriJBHeU)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Adventure%20Cartoonist%20%40LuBellWoo%20talks%20about%20money,%20fame%20and%20vulnerability%20at%20%40xoxo%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLveriJBHeU%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)][[buy her book](https://lucybellwood.com/baggywrinkles/)].
