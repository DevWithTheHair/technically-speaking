## Link Roundup

Another great article from [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall) on deciding which speaking events to accept [[read it](https://twitter.com/i/likes)][tweet it]. We love this, "The right speaking gig feels exciting and possibly a little scary, although not unsafe. Change is nerve-wracking, but often not dangerous. Jump on engagements that will stretch your abilities the most, especially if you can afford to be choosy! If the opportunity doesn’t interest you, pass it along to someone else."

## Inspiration

Beautiful commencement speech from [@brainpicker](http://twitter.com/brainpicker) [[read it](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/16/annenberg-commencement/)][tweet it]. We love how she weaves the metaphor of the electric bike to tell a story about privilege and comparing yourself to others.
