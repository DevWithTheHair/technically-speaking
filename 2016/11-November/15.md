# Edition 102

We're really sad about the events of last week and the on-going consequnces of the US election. For the past two years we have worked to create an inclusive space, to encourage inclusion where we find it, and to take a stand against the [kyriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy) where we can. We will continue to do so. Our thoughts are with those who are most at risk right now and we hope that all of you stay safe - and strong.

This week we have deciding which events to accept, time management and the panel moderator, and a story about an electric bicycle.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Buenos Aires and Colorado.

## Link Roundup

Another great article from [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall) on deciding which speaking events to accept [[read it](http://cattsmall.com/advice/2016/11/07/become-public-speaker-7.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20become%20a%20public%20speaker%20in%201%20year%20%E2%80%93%20Step%207%3A%20Accept%20opportunities%20by%20%40cattsmall%20http%3A//cattsmall.com/advice/2016/11/07/become-public-speaker-7.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love this, "The right speaking gig feels exciting and possibly a little scary, although not unsafe. Change is nerve-wracking, but often not dangerous. Jump on engagements that will stretch your abilities the most, especially if you can afford to be choosy! If the opportunity doesn’t interest you, pass it along to someone else."

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) is full of wisdom for moderator in this case the power they have to keep a panel on track and on time [[read it](http://www.moderatingpanels.com/2016/06/the-one-muscle-you-need-to-exercise-to.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Moderating%20Panels%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//www.moderatingpanels.com/2016/06/the-one-muscle-you-need-to-exercise-to.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love the tip that as a moderator, you can announce what is going to happen! And we agree - it's an under-utilized option.

[@the_thagomizer](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer/status/765250367466704896) writes about some of those less flattering invitations [[read it](http://www.thagomizer.com/blog/2016/08/12/diversity-is-not-a-checkbox.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Diversity%20is%20not%20a%20check%20box%20by%20%40the_thagomizer%20http%3A//www.thagomizer.com/blog/2016/08/12/diversity-is-not-a-checkbox.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "When events put me on stage because I’m a woman first and only then worry about if I’m even vaguely qualified it shakes my confidence. It also makes me concerned that if I mess up some jerk in the audience is going to have his “girls can’t do tech” beliefs reinforced instead of challenged."

We love this tip from [@alainakafkes](http://twitter.com/alainakafkes), "If you have ever built something that excites you, you’re halfway to a talk." Ideas for those who feel they have nothing to say [[read it](https://medium.com/real-solutions-artificial-intelligence/tech-talks-what-to-say-when-you-have-nothing-to-say-4d833f81636c#.xp39zkflk)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tech%20Talks%3A%20What%20to%20Say%20When%20You%20Have%20%22Nothing%20to%20Say%22%20by%20%40alainakafkes%20https%3A//medium.com/real-solutions-artificial-intelligence/tech-talks-what-to-say-when-you-have-nothing-to-say-4d833f81636c%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

A thorough look into what went into organizing Functional Swift in Budapest by [@vasarhelyia](http://twitter.com/vasarhelyia) [[read it](https://blog.alltheflow.com/organizing-functional-swift/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Organizing%20Functional%20Swift%20'16%20by%20%40vasarhelyia%20https%3A//blog.alltheflow.com/organizing-functional-swift/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

Beautiful commencement speech from [@brainpicker](http://twitter.com/brainpicker) [[read it](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/16/annenberg-commencement/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20the%20Soul-Sustaining%20Necessity%20of%20Resisting%20Self-Comparison%20%26%20Fighting%20Cynicism%20%40brainpicker%20https%3A//www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/16/annenberg-commencement/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love how she weaves the metaphor of the electric bike to tell a story about privilege and comparing yourself to others.
