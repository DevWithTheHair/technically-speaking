## Link Roundup

We're really excited about Char.la, which aims to increase the availability of technical content in Spanish [[read it](https://medium.com/colombia-dev/announcing-char-la-helping-bridge-the-spanish-speaking-tech-knowledge-gap-3d3bf56aea9e#.8nkv4dgap)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Announcing%20Char.la%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8AHelping%20bridge%20the%20Spanish%20speaking%20tech%20knowledge%20gap%20by%20%40buritica%20https%3A//medium.com/colombia-dev/announcing-char-la-helping-bridge-the-spanish-speaking-tech-knowledge-gap-3d3bf56aea9e%23.8nkv4dgap%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. As [@buritica](http://twitter.com/buritica) notes, "It’s quite unlikely that someone in Bucaramanga has had the need to deal with sharding a 300 million record NoSQL database, but it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t like to learn about it or wouldn’t be better engineers if they did. The privilege of speaking English should not limit access to knowledge, and Char.la is here to share advanced technical research, experience, problems, and content with the Spanish-speaking world."

Brilliant post from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on useless feedback that pathologizes natural behavior [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/10/lets-stop-tormenting-speakers-about.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Let%27s%20stop%20tormenting%20speakers%20about%20these%20four%20normal%20qualities%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/10/lets-stop-tormenting-speakers-about.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This point is everything, "So why are you customizing your presenting style for one listener? And is that listener really upset about something else, like the fact that you're speaking and he's not?"

[@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) writes up 11 helpful tips on improving your stage presence from Livingston Taylor [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/10/11-tips-for-toast-speech-presentation/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=11%20Tips%20for%20Improving%20Your%20Toast,%20Speech,%20or%20Presentation%20by%20%40gretchenrubin%20http%3A//gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/10/11-tips-for-toast-speech-presentation%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite is #3 - "Remember that your performance is just one aspect of the audience’s experience, which is also colored by the people they’re with, what else they’ll do with their day, etc."

We're charmed by the idea of the "flatter-nag" - "Asking someone to do something while simultaneously complimenting them." [[read it](https://kpresner.com/2014/06/09/the-gentle-art-of-the-flatter-nag/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Gentle%20Art%20of%20the%20Flatter-Nag%20by%20%40zoonini%20https%3A//kpresner.com/2014/06/09/the-gentle-art-of-the-flatter-nag/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

How do you explain code that is too dense to understand in a glance? [@notthepoint](https://twitter.com/notthepoint) dissected 6 lines of Fizz Buzz code by stepping aside on each hard-to-digest point and presenting a simpler example to illustrate how it works. While this particular program is over-the-top convoluted, this technique is useful for explaining all kinds of code [[watch it](https://vimeo.com/181409251)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=5%20WTFs%20in%206%20LOCs%3A%20%40notthepoint%20dissects%20convoluted%20code%20https%3A//vimeo.com/181409251%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
