## Link Roundup

It's election day today, and we don't know what we are more excited about - the hope of the first woman president... or for it all to be over. Hillary Clinton is an exceptional public speaker, and we've shared many things from that over the past... how long has this campaign been going? And so the last campaign related link - this witty and biting speech from the Al Smith dinner [[watch it](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/10/21/hillary_clinton_at_the_al_smith_dinner_was_hilarious_and_poignant.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20Al%20Smith%20Dinner%20Address%20Was%20Ridiculously%20Funny%20%26%20Beautifully%20Poignant%20http%3A//www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/10/21/hillary_clinton_at_the_al_smith_dinner_was_hilarious_and_poignant.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Be sure to read the analysis, and note the point about prforming for the audience outside the room.

[@Spacekatgal](http://twitter.com/Spacekatgal) tweeted about how speaking is not "easy money", with this important point "Bad speakers think the talk is all about them. Good speakers realize they need to provide value to the audience. That is a lot of work." [[read it](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/794172695764090880?lang=en)].

We're big fans of [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) and Mozilla's Tech Speakers program so we were delighted that they met in Berlin. [@freshelectrons](http://twitter.com/freshelectrons) shared some insight from the Tech Speakers program on the Eloquent Woman blog [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.ar/2016/11/keeping-it-real-with-mozilla-tech.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Keeping%20it%20real%20with%20Mozilla%20Tech%20Speakers%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/11/keeping-it-real-with-mozilla-tech.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. They used five minute lightening talks in order to iterate and learn from each other most effectively in a short space of time - amazing!

We're intruiged by [Help Me Abstract](http://helpmeabstract.com/). Submit your abstract and get feedback! 

Beautiful article by [@brainwane](http://twitter.com/brainwane) on what makes !!Con so special [[read it](https://recompilermag.com/issues/extras/toward-a-bangbangcon-aesthetic/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Towards%20%a%20%!!Con%20Aesthetic%20by%20%40brainwane%20https%3A//recompilermag.com/issues/extras/toward-a-bangbangcon-aesthetic/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We were particuarly struck by this quote, which illustrates the benefit of inclusive, curious, spaces, "I’ve found that participating at the Recurse Center, and spaces like it (such as !!Con), has made me a better programmer and a better person. I’m less afraid to try learning a new bit of technology, and to ask the questions I need to ask in order to learn."

## Inspiration

[@terriko](http://twitter.com/terriko) wrote up a talk she gave about healthy communities and saying no [[read it](http://curiousity.ca/2016/taking-no-for-an-answer-open-source-bridge-2016-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Taking%20No%20for%20an%20Answer%20by%20%40terriko%20http%3A//curiousity.ca/2016/taking-no-for-an-answer-open-source-bridge-2016-talk/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We're inspired by the accessibility descriptions added to each slide.
