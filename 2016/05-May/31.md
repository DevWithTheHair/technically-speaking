## Link Roundup

## Inspiration

We're big proponents of giving the talk that only you can give, so we loved this Famous Speech Friday showing how Michelle Obama did just that [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.de/2016/05/famous-speech-friday-michelle-obama-at.html)][tweet it]. We couldn't agree more with [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) "The next time you are preparing a presentation or speech, ask yourself: Could anyone else give this? If the answer is yes, put more of yourself into it."
