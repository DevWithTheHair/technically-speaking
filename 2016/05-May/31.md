# Edition 78

We were super happy to be a sponsor of [@selfconference](http://twitter.com/selfconference) in Detroit last week! It was an amazing event with some extraordinary speakers! Cate gave a talk "Some Things I've Learned About Color" [[storify](https://storify.com/catehstn/some-things-i-ve-learned-about-color-5740a7c2ee2c3624642eaf05)] but best of all got to meet a bunch of Technically Speaking subscribers. So much fun! Thanks [@crebma](http://twitter.com/crebma) and congratulations on organizing such an awesome event.

## Link Roundup

Google developers has a video series on Public Speaking Pro Tips, featuring improv exercises from [Speechless](http://speechlesslive.com), the improv show [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFbmJSyuKk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb&index=1)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20Speaking%20Pro%20Tips%20%28From%20Presenter%20to%20Performer%29%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrkFbmJSyuKk%26list%3DPLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb%26index%3D1%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lots of fun things to try!

This article on the double bind women face when they speak up is full of on-point observations [[read it](v)][tweet it]. We love this quote on Melissa Harris-Perry, "The best part of this story is that not only did MHP choose freedom over silence by leaving MSNBC, but she also did it by refusing to sign a non-disparagement clause on her way out. The network assumed she would exchange her silence for cash in their exit negotiations, but she didn’t. And then she simply carried on speaking truth."

Interesting article from a conference organizer on their perspective on wanting to pay speakers [[read it](http://visible-quality.blogspot.com/2016/02/changing-world-of-conferences-pay.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20Seasoned%20Tester%27s%20Crystal%20Ball%3A%20Changing%20the%20world%20of%20conferences%3A%20pay%20the%20speakers%20http%3A//visible-quality.blogspot.com/2016/02/changing-world-of-conferences-pay.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It's great to see conference organizers considering this!

If you saw the tweets about Google I/O this year but didn't really follow, one attendee goes into detail about the experience [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-google-io-2016-worst-tech-event-ive-ever-attended-greg-bulmash)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20Google%20I/O%202016%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Tech%20Event%20I%27ve%20Ever%20Attended%20%7C%20Greg%20Bulmash%20%7C%20LinkedIn%20https%3A//www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-google-io-2016-worst-tech-event-ive-ever-attended-greg-bulmash%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Event organizers weren't prepared for the volume of people, or the heat, in a way that put attendees at risk. At $900 a ticket, SHAME.

[@berkun](http://twitter.com/berkun) lays it down with the short honest truth of what it takes to be a good public speaker - practise [[read it](http://scottberkun.com/2016/how-to-be-a-better-speaker/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20To%20Be%20a%20Better%20Speaker%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Short%20Honest%20Truth%20%7C%20Scott%20Berkun%20by%20%40berkun%20http%3A//scottberkun.com/2016/how-to-be-a-better-speaker/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, "When you see a presentation that is smart, polished and looks natural, never forget how much effort was required to make it seem so effortless."

## Inspiration

We're big proponents of giving the talk that only you can give, so we loved this Famous Speech Friday showing how Michelle Obama did just that [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.de/2016/05/famous-speech-friday-michelle-obama-at.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Famous%20Speech%20Friday%3A%20Michelle%20Obama%20at%20Tuskegee%20University%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.de/2016/05/famous-speech-friday-michelle-obama-at.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We couldn't agree more with [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) "The next time you are preparing a presentation or speech, ask yourself: Could anyone else give this? If the answer is yes, put more of yourself into it."
