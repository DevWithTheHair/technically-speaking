## Link Roundup

Google developers has a video series on Public Speaking Pro Tips, featuring improv exercises from [Speechless](http://speechlesslive.com), the improv show [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFbmJSyuKk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb&index=1)][tweet it]. Lots of fun things to try!

This article on the double bind women face when they speak up is full of on-point observations [[read it](v)][tweet it]. We love this quote on Melissa Harris-Perry, "The best part of this story is that not only did MHP choose freedom over silence by leaving MSNBC, but she also did it by refusing to sign a non-disparagement clause on her way out. The network assumed she would exchange her silence for cash in their exit negotiations, but she didn’t. And then she simply carried on speaking truth."

Interesting article from a conference organizer on their perspective on wanting to pay speakers [[read it](http://visible-quality.blogspot.com.co/2016/02/changing-world-of-conferences-pay.html)][tweet it]. It's great to see conference organizers considering this!

## Inspiration

We're big proponents of giving the talk that only you can give, so we loved this Famous Speech Friday showing how Michelle Obama did just that [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.de/2016/05/famous-speech-friday-michelle-obama-at.html)][tweet it]. We couldn't agree more with [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) "The next time you are preparing a presentation or speech, ask yourself: Could anyone else give this? If the answer is yes, put more of yourself into it."
