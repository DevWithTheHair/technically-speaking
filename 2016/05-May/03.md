# Edition 75

We are so excited to announce our two sustaining sponsors [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge) and [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci). Their commitment ensures that Technically Speaking will continue through to the end of 2016. 

This week we have multiple perspectives on preparing talks, the trouble with women's events, the importance of the kids track, and some tips on presenting code!

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from NYC where Cate is celebrating her birthday with [the Cookie Monster in Times Square](https://twitter.com/catehstn/status/726923025514397696).  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**

## Link Roundup

Fascinating story of what goes into preparing for a TED talk and what it was like by [@waitbutwhy](http://twitter.com/waitbutwhy), in particular the options for level of memorization [[read it](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Doing%20a%20TED%20Talk%3A%20The%20Full%20Story%20by%20%40waitbutwhy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1SYuzo9)]. We love the exploration of difficulty for the speaker versus interest for the audience.

Cate wrote about some of the reasons that she rarely speaks at women's events [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/21/the-trouble-with-womens-events/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Trouble%20with%20Women's%20Events%20by%20%40catehstn%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/26No7UR)]. Key point: because many such events are fund-raisers, they operate under different constraints and might benefit from some more transparency.

[@beerops](http://twitter.com/beerops) wrote about what goes into preparing for a talk [[read it](https://beero.ps/2016/04/14/on-a-conference-speaking-routine/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20a%20Conference%20Speaking%20Routine%20by%20%40beerops%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1TsnQgx)]. A PDF saved in Google Drive or another cloud service is a safety net that hopefully you never need... but imagine if you ever do! Getting on stage is really scary, and so being deliberate about what you need to feel as good as you can about it, and making sure that you have that is a really helpful way to calm nerves.

Great tips on presenting code effectively from [@lookatmyslides](https://twitter.com/lookatmyslides) [[read it](http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Presenting%20code%20effectively%20by%20%40lookatmyslides%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware)]. Use monospaced font, make it big, highlight smartly, omit with ellipsis, and annotate.

We appreciated this post from [@jeffwatkins](http://twitter.com/jeffwatkins) on the importance of the kids track. [[read it](https://metrocat.org/2016/04/thinking-about-ull)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20importance%20of%20the%20kids%20track%20at%20conferences%20by%20%40jeffwatkins%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//metrocat.org/2016/04/thinking-about-ull)]. Childcare is often framed as a woman's issue, and it's refreshing to hear a man's perspective on it.

## Inspiration

We are inspired and honored by this lovely collage from [@lisamarienyc](https://twitter.com/lisamarienyc). She summarized her public speaking journey with various photos, starting with her [Technically Speaking t-shirt](https://teespring.com/technically-speaking-first) [[read it](https://twitter.com/lisamarienyc/status/726531258738708480)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Lovely%20public%20speaking%20photo%20collage%20by%20%40lisamarienyc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//twitter.com/lisamarienyc/status/726531258738708480)]. What a fun way to celebrate!
