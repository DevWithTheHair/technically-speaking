## Link Roundup

[@colettecello] shared her experience at OpenStack and it wasn't good [[read it](https://twitter.com/colettecello/status/726877953183854593)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=via%20%40techspeakdigest%20https%3A//twitter.com/colettecello/status/726877953183854593)]. Key quote, "Sadly, the floor for "least sexist tech conference" still involves me being okay with being stared at a lot more than I normally am."

We love love love the idea of Diversity Tickets [[read it](https://diversitytickets.org/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=DiversityTickets%20https%3A//diversitytickets.org/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Event organizers! Submit your event! Would be attendees! Apply!

This write up about Try!Swift by [@inamiy](http://twitter.com/inamiy)is charming [[read it](http://developers.linecorp.com/blog/?p=3748)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=try%21%20Swift%20Presentation%20Report%20%C2%AB%20LINE%20Engineers%27%20Blog%20by%20%40inamiy%20http%3A//developers.linecorp.com/blog/%3Fp%3D3748%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, "Simply put, I experienced what I can only call “culture shock,” but only in a positive light."

We were pleased to see this transparancy report from [@DjangoConEurope](http://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope) [[read it](https://2016.djangocon.eu/blog/article/2016-04-11-coc-transparency-report/#blogcontent)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=DjangoCon%20Europe%202016%20by%20%40DjangoConEurope%20https%3A//2016.djangocon.eu/blog/article/2016-04-11-coc-transparency-report/%23blogcontent%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We couldn't agree more with this point "We are not publishing this list to shame anyone or pat ourselves on the back. We believe that transparency on this subject is important in order to give everyone some visibility on what happens “behind the scenes”. We want to show everyone why our CoC is important but also how it is enforced in practice."  

For a more personal take on enforcing the CoC and "empathy duty" (great phrase!) read this by [@asendecka](http://twitter.com/asendecka) [[read it](http://blog.sendecka.me/post/142478065688/djangocon-empathy-duty#142478065688)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Inspiration%2C%20dreams%20and%20thoughts.%20%E2%80%94%20DjangoCon%20Empathy%20Duty%20by%20%40asendecka%20http%3A//blog.sendecka.me/post/142478065688/djangocon-empathy-duty%23142478065688%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "If you organize the conference and you will be in a Code of Conduct team, my advice for you is to make sure you are well rested, you have loads of energy, you are not burned out or overwhelmed by anything - you will need all your empathy and stamina."
