## Link Roundup

[@colettecello] shared her experience at OpenStack and it wasn't good [[read it](https://twitter.com/colettecello/status/726877953183854593)]. Key quote, "Sadly, the floor for "least sexist tech conference" still involves me being okay with being stared at a lot more than I normally am."

We love love love the idea of Diversity Tickets [[read it](https://diversitytickets.org/)][tweet it]. Event organizers! Submit your event! Would be attendees! Apply!

This write up about Try!Swift by [@inamiy](http://twitter.com/inamiy)is charming [[read it](http://developers.linecorp.com/blog/?p=3748)][tweet it]. Our favourite quote, "Simply put, I experienced what I can only call “culture shock,” but only in a positive light."
