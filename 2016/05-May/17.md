## Link Roundup

We love the post from [@skamille](http://twitter.com/skamille) sharing her process for writing it [[read it](https://medium.com/@skamille/my-process-writing-a-talk-de55a870f2e7)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%22Hopelessness%20and%20Confidence%20in%20Distributed%20Systems%20Design%22%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlU1opuCXB0%20/by%20%40skamille%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)] which reminds us first to focus on our audience (key quote: “I do an exercise to refocus me on the audience. Who are they? I described them as “curious, cautious, nervous.” OK. What is the unique point of view that I can bring that group?”), secondly that preparation is hard, and thirdly that we all doubt ourselves.  

Chiu-Ki wrote about becoming a confident speaker [[read it](http://blog.sqisland.com/2012/06/how-to-be-confident-speaker.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20be%20a%20confident%20speaker%20by%20%40chiuki%20http%3A//bit.ly/MeKuu3%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%0A)]. Key quote, "You cannot learn to ride the bicycle by reading a book. Start small, give a short talk at a local meetup. Be yourself, and go with the flow. You will be alright."  

One comment we hear a lot from nervous would-be speakers is “what if everyone knows what I have to say?” so we were keen to read [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught)’s take on assuming that people know what you know [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/4-risks-when-you-assume-your-audience.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=4%20risks%20when%20you%20assume%20your%20audience%20knows%20what%20you%20know%20-%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/4-risks-when-you-assume-your-audience.html%20/by%20%40dontgetcaught%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway: if you make too many assumptions about your audience's knowledge you risk giving an opaque presentation and alienating parts of your audience.  

Cate wrote about some of the less flattering speaking invitations she gets, for the “token woman” speaking slot [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/03/11/the-woman-speaker-slot/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Woman%20Speaking%20Slot%20by%20%40catehstn%20http%3A//bit.ly/1TWL54R%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%0A)]. Remember even if the organizer makes you feel like a token, the audience won’t know - but don’t feel bad about saying no!  

Old but still relevant, [@berkun](http://twitter.com/berkun) wrote about how to give a great ignite talk [[read it](http://scottberkun.com/2009/how-to-give-a-great-ignite-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20To%20Give%20a%20Great%20Ignite%20Talk%20by%20%40berkun%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Tdyb5C%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%0A)]. "In many ways it takes more craft to make a short talk work well than a long one." - so true!  

## Inspiration

Questions seem to be one of the top fears of would-be speakers, but we're inspired to embrace them by this flowchart on asking questions by [@anyharder](https://twitter.com/anyharder) [[read it](http://blog.annharter.com/2015/08/21/a-guide-to-talking.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20Guide%20to%20Talking,%20in%20flowchart%20form%20by%20%40anyharder%20http%3A//bit.ly/1SsTEWL%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and it comes with some good points on asking questions in general, “In my experience, good thoughtful questions enhance the experience of both speaker and audience. Speaking is hard, and a lot of people get very nervous while presenting. You shouldn’t let that prevent you from asking hard questions, but with a little thoughtfulness, you can do that without being a jerk. Bad questions have the possibility to derail everything, and the point of asking your question should not be that!”
