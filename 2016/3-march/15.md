# Edition 69

Chiu-Ki is hosting a Q&A Hangout for her conference, [360|AnDev](http://360andev.com/call-for-papers/), on March 22. Come and ask all your public speaking questions, whether you are an Android developer or not. Here is a previous edition for [Droidcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6sbrgZz-_o) if you are curious what kind of questions people asked [[sign up](https://plus.google.com/events/cjmklls3l9b9d391hjj5fl3umt8)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/360andev/status/703658707725320192)].  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

We don’t have a sponsor this week so we figured it was a nice time to tell y’all about some of our projects! Cate launched her iOS app Show & Hide in December, it makes cool, partially colored images [[about](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/09/launching-show-hide/)][[buy it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/show-hide/id950349795?ls=1&mt=8)]. Chiu-Ki has an adorable Android pedometer app & watch face called Fit Cat, with leaderboard & achievements to motivate you to walk more [[about](http://blog.sqisland.com/search/label/fitcat)][[buy it](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sqisland.fitcat)].  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Seattle, where Cate is hanging out [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge).

## Link Roundup  

March is Women’s History Month, and [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) has marked the occasion with a list of 39 Famous Speeches from Women [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/03/39-famous-speeches-by-women-to-open.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=39%20famous%20speeches%20by%20women%20to%20open%20%23WomensHistoryMonth%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/22hlgQX%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and another list of 11 speeches from women in technology [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/03/11-famous-speeches-by-women-in.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=11%20famous%20speeches%20by%20women%20in%20engineering%20%26%20technology%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//bit.ly/1MjvG9q%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. As Kathleen Hall Jamieson wrote "History has many themes. One of them is that women should be quiet." Here’s to women not being quiet in 2016 and beyond.  

The story in this post by [@eads](https://twitter.com/eads) captures why it’s not enough to reactively deal with events, you have to proactively create an inclusive space [[read it](https://medium.com/@davideads/coding-standards-2-origin-stories-f079439ff23a#.yulzbfgda)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Proactively%20create%20an%20inclusive%20space%20by%20%40eads%20http%3A//bit.ly/21itKFb%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote: “We kicked out the guy and made sure he never came back, but the damage was done. The woman left, angry and clearly shaken. She never came back either.” (Note the code of conduct they have is not a good example to work from, but the point made about having one is worthwhile, so we include it here with that caveat.)  

[@mennenia](https://twitter.com/mennenia) wrote about why it’s worth getting started with public speaking [[read it](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/09/public-speaking-part1-is-it-for-me/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20Speaking%20-%20Part%201%3A%20Is%20It%20For%20Me?%20by%20%40mennenia%20http%3A//bit.ly/1LnBsfr%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote is this one on not needing to be an expert, “Speak about a topic that truly interests you and take this time to uncover things you’ve always wanted to know. It does not require you to be an expert up front — sharing knowledge gives you the chance to become one.”  

We always love reading people’s “How I Got Into Public Speaking” stories so we’re delighted [@geekygirlsarah](https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah) shared hers [[read it](https://medium.com/@geekygirlsarah/my-adventures-of-my-first-year-of-conference-speaking-f61def383e27)] [[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20Adventures%20of%20My%20First%20Year%20of%20Conference%20Speaking%20by%20%40geekygirlsarah%20http%3A//bit.ly/21UNzrG%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We laughed (and cheered!) about finding herself in the situation where she had planned to give a talk four times… when she hadn’t written it yet, and we really enjoyed learning about the evolution of the talk and how she refined it based on feedback.  

Chiu-Ki was on [@lessthanorequal](https://twitter.com/lessthanorequal) talking about freelancing, and public speaking as a way to showcase expertise [[listen](https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/82)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20speaking%20tips%20from%20%40chiuki%20on%20%40lessthanorequal%20http%3A//bit.ly/1U2Vfnr%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite thing was that after talking to Cate host [@Aleen](https://twitter.com/aleen?lang=en-gb) had started putting together talks to submit, and Chiu-Ki helped her refine her ideas further! Getting into public speaking might be something of a hazard of speaking to us…  

## Inspiration  

“Shall I Compare Thee to a Line of Code?” [@devdame](https://twitter.com/devdame) shares a few poems, explains the sonnet form, and gradually shows us how good poems and good code are similar. Did you know that poetry follows the principle of DRY, just like Ruby on Rails? [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvFRf8aDrrU)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Shall%20I%20Compare%20Thee%20to%20a%20Line%20of%20Code?%20by%20%40devdame%0Ahttps%3A//youtu.be/KvFRf8aDrrU%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]
