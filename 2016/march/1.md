# Edition 67

We were super happy to sponsor [@AlterConf](https://twitter.com/AlterConf) Washington DC in January. [@ashedryden](https://twitter.com/ashedryden) and team continue to set the bar for running an inclusive event and supporting first time speakers. You can see some of the Sketchnotes from the event [here](http://katherinehaugh.com/alterconf-dc-increasing-diversity-in-the-tech-industry/). [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com/) is an inclusive traveling conference series focused on moving the discussions around diversity in tech & gaming beyond a 101 level. AlterConf is seeking companies who support diversity for [sponsorship opportunities](http://alterconf.com/sponsor).

## Link Roundup  

Chiu-ki was on the [@CodeNewbies](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) podcast [[listen](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/technically-speaking)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=.%40chiuki%20talks%20Technically%20Speaking%20and%20learning%20how%20to%20self-promote%20on%20%40CodeNewbies%20http%3A//www.codenewbie.org/podcast/technically-speaking%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]! She talked about learning to self-promote, covert menteeing, and, of course, Technically Speaking!  

Ideas from [@jessejiryudavis](http://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis) on how to prep a talk [[read it](https://emptysqua.re/blog/how-i-write-a-conference-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Do%20Your%20Slides%20At%20The%20Last%20Minute%3A%208%20Steps%20To%20Writing%20Your%20PyCon%20Talk%20by%20%40jessejiryudavis%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1oOWfOT)]. It’s focused on Python but other than assuming you already have a thorough outline is generally applicable.  

Thought-provoking piece on women focused conferences [[read it](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-feel-good-female-solidarity-machine/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Feel-Good%20Female%20Solidarity%20Machine%20by%20%40sheelahk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bloom.bg/1Ravaw2)]. Our favourite quote: “Having been to many of these events, and having eagerly participated in a few, I can attest that they’re often stirring and, yes, inspirational. It can be galvanizing to be around so many females with superhuman résumés, to hear their tales of surviving corporate battles or even actual wars. You often leave with a rosy glow, a sense of resolve, and a commitment to do more, for other women and for yourself. But then you return to your desk, probably next to a higher-paid male co-worker, and the old, familiar malaise sets in. There was no discussion of changing policies or lobbying members of Congress. No e-mail list to stay in touch and organize. In the end, one wonders if the explosion of these events is a reflection of how far women have come or proof that they haven’t made much progress at all. Why, in spite of all the energy these conferences generate, are women still just … talking?”  

[@rabbitonweb](https://twitter.com/rabbitonweb) wrote a rant about how little many people get out of attending conferences, and how bigger does not always mean better [[read it](http://www.rabbitonweb.com/2016/02/25/anticonference/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Anticonference%20by%20%40rabbitonweb%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1oGdLnZ)].  

Congratulations to [@practice_cactus](https://twitter.com/practice_cactus) on giving her first conference talk! We love that she wrote about her experience [[read it](http://emojiparty.net/blog/posts/my-first-conference-talk-what-worked-and-what-didn-t)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20First%20Conference%20Talk%20-%20What%20Worked%20and%20What%20Didn%27t!%20by%20%40practice_cactus%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1QbcoXz)]. Lots of good tips! Rather than giving advice, which can be daunting, she framed it as what worked and what didn’t. We can all learn from each other, whether it was your first time speaking or you give talks as a living. Share your story and send us a link!  

## Inspiration  

A powerful talk from [@_K_E_L_S_E_Y](https://twitter.com/_K_E_L_S_E_Y) on our moral obligations as software engineers to stand up to social injustice. Watch Kelsey tell the story of Harry Bridges, longshoremen in SF, labor unions, and how it all relates to the tech industry [[watch it](http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2016/01/06/what-tech-workers-can-learn-from-harry-bridges/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20Tech%20Workers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Harry%20Bridges%20by%20%40_k_e_l_s_e_y%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Te2x7q)].
