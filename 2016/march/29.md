# Edition 70

Did you miss us last week? We missed you!  

Last week we decided to go on strike (how European of us), because this newsletter is only sustainable with support, and we had a second sponsor-free week. One thing we have noticed, is that because Technically Speaking is run by women, and tries to be reflective of the tech industry we *wish we saw*, is that we often get branded as being a “diversity initiative”, and when this happens our sponsorship levels drop. There are a number of problems with this. Firstly, we genuinely believe that Technically Speaking is for everyone (fear of public speaking is one of life’s universals) - but we just take a definition of everyone that is actually *everyone*. Secondly, the devaluing of work done by women for the “collective” concerns us. As the conversation about “diversity” (we prefer “inclusivity”) has become more and more prominent, we have started to ask for Thankless Emotional Labour for the collective from our communities, not just within companies. We disagree.  

So, we went on strike.  

**It’s important to us that Technically Speaking is sustainable, so if you benefit from it please think about asking your company to support us to keep supporting you and over 2300 other people with your professional development. Weekly sponsorships are 250 USD, and we are looking for companies to be Sustainability Partners with monthly support through the end of the year.**  

If you find our digests useful, we’d love it if you forwarded them to your friends and encouraged them to [sign up](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak). For those who hate email, we also [tweet](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest).  

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@kickstarter](https://twitter.com/kickstarter)! Kickstarter is hiring - [https://www.kickstarter.com/jobs](https://www.kickstarter.com/jobs)  - come build awesome mission-driven product!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colombia and Colorado - we are both “home”.  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**

## Link Roundup  

Musings by [@pikesley](https://twitter.com/pikesley) on how once we truly understand something, it’s inconceivable that we could not understand that thing, and how that can relate to imposter syndrome prepping talks [[read it](http://sam.pikesley.org/blog/2016/02/10/rhapsody-on-a-theme-of-imposter-syndrome/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Rhapsody%20On%20A%20Theme%20Of%20Imposter%20Syndrome%20by%20%40pikesley%20via%20http%3A//bit.ly/1UyvN9y%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key takeaway - just because something now seems obvious to you, you probably worked hard to get to that point, so be mindful of negating that work when you present it to other people - you risk making them feel stupid, when the truth is they just haven’t done that work yet.  

A collection of resources on speaker pay from [@callbackwomen](https://twitter.com/callbackwomen?lang=en) [[read it](http://www.callbackwomen.com/speaker-pay.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Resources%20on%20Speaker%20Pay%20by%20%40callbackwomen%20http%3A//www.callbackwomen.com/speaker-pay.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Reminder: we think provision for speaker travel costs is an inclusivity issue, which is why we always highlight whether speaker travel costs are covered.  

We are fascinated and a little bit confused by the concept of a fictional conference… accepting real submissions [[read it](http://www.fictionalconference.com/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20International%20Fictional%20Conference%20on%20Design%20Fiction%E2%80%99s%20Futures%20by%20%40fictionalconf%20http%3A//www.fictionalconference.com%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

We think a page about talks you want to give can be a great idea, and here’s an example by [@kavbojka](https://twitter.com/kavbojka) [[read it](http://camilleacey.blogspot.ca/2016/03/talk-talk.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Talks%20that%20%40kavbojka%20wants%20to%20give%20http%3A//camilleacey.blogspot.com/2016/03/talk-talk.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Even if you still need to submit to CfPs - or never publish it - the act of sitting down and thinking about what you would like to speak about can be really helpful!  

We’ve been following the drama around Lambda Conf inviting a speaker who has written (amongst other things) slavery apologia, and Cate read and live-rage-tweeted the nonsense response from the conference organizer so you don’t have to [[read it](https://twitter.com/catehstn/status/714650062127763457)]. For a more thoughtful and thorough response, we liked this by [@alissapajer](https://twitter.com/alissapajer) [[read it](http://alissapajer.github.io/posts/2016-03-26-lambdaconf.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Thoughts%20on%20LambdaConf%202016%20by%20%40alissapajer%20http%3A//bit.ly/1UYZHSY%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], which unpacks the topic of how “inclusion” doesn’t actually mean everyone is included because some people are by default, and historically, excluded.  The speaker in question came out with a response himself, helpfully translated by [@codepaintsleep](https://twitter.com/codepaintsleep), ostensibly about why conference-goers shouldn’t fear him, but in practise was just a rambly and disorganized defence of his most offensive writing [[read it](https://medium.com/@codepaintsleep/i-paraphrased-the-entirety-of-this-post-because-i-couldn-t-understand-it-without-going-through-59ca5d86f227#.mj4nlptia)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Response%20to%20LambdaConf%20from%20Curtis%20Yarvin%20paraphrased%20by%20%40codepaintsleep%20http%3A//bit.ly/1LVT0zA%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. There’s a lot to unpack here, but one big thing the organizers seem to have missed is that physically safe does not mean actually welcome. An alternative event is [MoonConf](http://moonconf.org/), where profits will (fittingly) go in support of [BlackGirlsCODE](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/).  

## Inspiration  

We are inspired by [@purpleyay](https://twitter.com/purpleyay)’s blog post about how she prepares for a talk [[read it](http://gwendolyn.io/preparing-a-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20I%20Prepare%20a%20Talk%20by%20%20%40purpleyay%20http%3A//bit.ly/1TK9GMM%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite tip: scheduling run throughs with friends for accountability and maximum terror!
