# Edition 68

This week Cate was on a podcast talking Shine Theory, and Chiu-Ki hosted an event! We also have some real-talk on asking marginalized people to write codes of conduct, why some women *won’t* speak at GHC, a great example of encouraging an international audience to mingle, and we’re inspired to… ask better questions.

*From [@rallat](https://twitter.com/rallat): Øredev is a really well organized conference with many different tracks and different topics. Last year there was a biohacking talk! Øredev is in the charming city of Malmö, Sweden. It is a great conference to get closer to the European developer community and to learn more about Sweden culture too. Last year organizers give speakers the opportunity to enjoy Sauna with a dip on the Baltic sea and stinky herring for dinner.*  

## Link Roundup  

Happy International Women’s Day! Chiu-Ki ran a night of lightning talks at GDG Boulder featuring women from the local community. It was a great platform for first-time speakers to give a short talk and have a recording to apply to speak at other events [[read it](http://bit.ly/1U0OJNB)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Lightning%20talks%20at%20%40gdgboulder%20provided%20a%20great%20platform%20for%20first-time%20speakers%20http%3A//bit.ly/1U0OJNB%0Avia%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

We love this blog post that [@k_katsumi ](https://twitter.com/k_katsumi)wrote in advance of [@tryswiftconf](https://twitter.com/tryswiftconf) encouraging attendees to speak to the visiting speakers [[read it](http://blog.kishikawakatsumi.com/entry/2016/02/28/075454)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tips%20about%20speaking%20to%20foreigners%20and%20making%20an%20effort%20at%20%40tryswiftconf%20by%20%40k_katsumi%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OYbTvW%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It’s in Japanese, so you may need to use Google Translate (normally automatic in Chrome) to read it, but includes tips about speaking to foreigners and making an effort - including bringing an app to show them! Cate spoke at Try!Swift and had an amazing time, and this kind of effort from the organizers was a big part of why.  

Must read from [@Karnythia](https://twitter.com/Karnythia) who lays it down on cons that allow broken stairs to fester and asks would-be-community members to accommodate them [[read it](http://mikkikendall.com/2016/02/24/on-bad-cons-how-you-kill-an-event-in-advance/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20Bad%20Cons%20%26%20How%20You%20Kill%20An%20Event%20in%20Advance%20by%20%40Karnythia%20http%3A//bit.ly/1LNPiHK%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. “I get invited to a lot of cons that have a diversity problem. I also get a lot of requests from cons that claim to want to create anti harassment policies. Aside from my feelings on an expectation that I donate hours of work to strangers for events I have no interest in attending, there’s the sad reality that many small cons are so entrenched on reinventing the wheel they’ve missed the window to do better.”  

[@gayle](https://twitter.com/gayle) wrote about why she won’t be speaking at GHC [[read it](https://medium.com/@gayle/why-i-won-t-be-speaking-at-grace-hopper-2071df640fc2)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Be%20Speaking%20at%20the%20Grace%20Hopper%20Conference%20by%20%40gayle%20http%3A//bit.ly/1UP02aV%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We both have a fondness for GHC, because it’s where we met, and there’s something to be said about a crowd of thousands of technical women! However we never speak at conferences that ask us to pay for a ticket either, and support Gayle’s transparency here.  

Cate was on [@lessthanorequal](https://twitter.com/lessthanorequal) talking Technically Speaking, Codes of Conduct, healthy work environments, and Shine Theory with the amazing [@Aleen](https://twitter.com/Aleen) [[listen](https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/81)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Podcast%3A%20%40catehstn%20on%20%40lessthanorequal%20re%20%40techspeakdigest,%20Codes%20of%20Conduct,%20healthy%20work%20env%20%26%20Shine%20Theory%20%0Ahttps%3A//www.relay.fm/ltoe/81)]. We’ve both been really enjoying recording podcasts (what a great way to practise extemporaneous speaking!) so if there’s a podcast you think we should be on, we’d love it if you recommended us.  

## Inspiration  

Many of us dread Q & A at the end of our talks. But questions are love! We’re inspired by this guide from [@cosleydr](https://twitter.com/cosleydr) to ask better, more thoughtful questions [[read it](http://blogs.cornell.edu/danco/2013/02/18/on-asking-questions-and-academic-love)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20Asking%20Questions%20and%20Academic%20Love%20by%20%40cosleydr%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1pfLghk)].
