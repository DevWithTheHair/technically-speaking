## Link Roundup

The open secret of Jacob Appelbaum is all over the internet lately, and prompted Noisebridge to release a statement [[read it](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Statement_on_Jacob_Appelbaum)][tweet it]. We are happy to see events acknowledging previous failures, because pretending that nothing ever happened when *everyone knows otherwise* is really damaging. This quote, "What we can say for sure is that Jacob's behavior, as alleged, along with many incidents we regrettably overlooked in the past now would trigger the Noisebridge Anti-Harassment Policy. We did not have a culture or structure for people to bring forward claims - we do now. Because of this Jacob is no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces.".
