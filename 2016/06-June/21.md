# Edition 81

We had an amazing time at Write Speak Code this week, so of course we had to include two great links relating to it and no doubt there will be more to come. We also have an update on things we've been doing with the newsletter, an open secret that is no longer secret, and an awesome worksheet for generating ideas of things to talk about!

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from London, where Cate is attending [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) (if you can find her, she has stickers!)  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**  

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running [360|AnDev in Denver, July 28-29](http://360andev.com/). Cate is co-mc at [Try!Swift NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com/) in September.

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote a bit of an update on some things we've been doing [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/21/technically-speaking-update/)][tweet it]. This includes some transparancy into what we've been doing with sponsorship money.

The open secret of Jacob Appelbaum is all over the internet lately, and prompted Noisebridge to release a statement [[read it](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Statement_on_Jacob_Appelbaum)][tweet it]. We are happy to see events acknowledging previous failures, because pretending that nothing ever happened when *everyone knows otherwise* is really damaging. This quote, "What we can say for sure is that Jacob's behavior, as alleged, along with many incidents we regrettably overlooked in the past now would trigger the Noisebridge Anti-Harassment Policy. We did not have a culture or structure for people to bring forward claims - we do now. Because of this Jacob is no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces.".

This worksheet by [@lucykbain](http://twitter.com/lucykbain) is super helpful for generating ideas of what to talk about [[read it](http://lucybain.com/blog/2016/conference-proposal-ideas)][tweet it]! We love the idea of dedicating 30 minutes and if you have nothing you are off the hook - the questions are so great though, that we can't really imagine that being the case.  

This rant from [@rmillerwebster](http://twitter.com/rmillerwebster) about organizing a community conference is eye-opening [[read it](http://www.rebeccamiller-webster.com/2016/06/the-realities-of-organizing-a-community-tech-conference-an-ill-advised-rant/)][tweet it], especially this quote on sponsors, "Most conferences I have organized end up with at least one sponsor who never pays." - woah!  

We loved this guide from [@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) on how to write a lightening talk [[read it](http://www.heidiwaterhouse.com/2016/06/19/how-to-write-a-lightning-talk/)][tweet it]. It sounds like a great workshop! Our favourite tip? "I always pick talk topics based on something I’m angry about. I find that’s a good place for me to find the energy to drive a speaking project forward."



## Inspiration

We're inspired by this bonus 13th episode in the first season of Should We podcast [[listen](https://shouldwe.co/should-we-keep-going-ae6dd114e477#.q2rj24j1e)][tweet it] - on the question "should we speak up?" we say, YES YES YES.
