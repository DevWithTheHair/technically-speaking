## Link Roundup

The Lead Developer last week had captioning of all talks (amazing!) and we love this post about why it's helpful by [@tosbourn](http://twitter.com/tosbourn) [[read it](http://tosbourn.com/captioning-at-conferences/)][tweet it] - not just for the hard of hearing, it's great for catching up if you missed a word.
