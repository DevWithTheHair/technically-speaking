## Link Roundup

Cate had an amazing time last week at the Lead Developer in London and wrote up a trip report [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/28/trip-report-the-lead-developer-2016)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Trip%20Report%20-%20The%20Lead%20Developer%202016%20-%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/28/trip-report-the-lead-developer-2016/%20/by%20%40catehstn%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest%0A%0A)]. It was so great to hear from so many speakers that they have been reading Technically Speaking!  

Chiu-Ki moderated the Conference Organizers Panel at Write/Speak/Code last week and collected the tweets in this storify [[read it](https://storify.com/chiuki/conference-organizers-panel-2016)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20Organizers%20Panel%20at%20%40WriteSpeakCode%20by%20%40chiuki%20https%3A//storify.com/chiuki/conference-organizers-panel-2016%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lots of practical tips such as rewriting "I will talk about" to "You will learn about" to focus on the audience.

The Lead Developer had captioning of all talks (amazing!) and we love this post about why it's helpful by [@tosbourn](http://twitter.com/tosbourn) [[read it](http://tosbourn.com/captioning-at-conferences)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Captioning%20at%20Conferences%20by%20%40tosbourn%20http%3A//tosbourn.com/captioning-at-conferences%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] - not just for the hard of hearing, it's great for catching up if you missed a word.

Some fantastic tips in this post from [@DianaLRendina](http://twitter.com/DianaLRendina) [[read it](http://renovatedlearning.com/2016/03/14/create-killer-conference-proposal)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20Create%20a%20Killer%20Conference%20Proposal%20%7C%20Renovated%20Learning%20by%20%40DianaLRendina%20http%3A//renovatedlearning.com/2016/03/14/create-killer-conference-proposal%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite is about titles, "The title says so much about a presentation. You want something that sounds catchy and interesting, but also timeless. Avoid really current pop culture references, as they often start to sound dated by the time the conference comes around."

The start of a series of posts about becoming a speaker by [@jefBinomed](http://twitter.com/jefBinomed) [[read it](http://jef.binomed.fr/2016/03/11/2016-03-11-comment-devenir-speaker-part-1)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Comment%20devenir%20speaker%20%3F%20%28Partie%201%29%20%7C%20Binomed%20Blog%20by%20%40jefBinomed%20http%3A//jef.binomed.fr/2016/03/11/2016-03-11-comment-devenir-speaker-part-1%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love the idea that feelings of "imposter syndrome" are actually a sign that you want to bring something to the audience.


## Inspiration

We're inspired by [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall)'s one year journey to becoming a public speaker, and loved this post on building confidence [[read it](https://medium.com/@cattsmall/how-to-become-a-public-speaker-in-1-year-step-1-build-confidence-253aa61b4d52)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20become%20a%20public%20speaker%20in%201%20year%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8AStep%201%3A%20Build%20Confidence%20by%20%40cattsmall%20http%3A//bit.ly/28ZTSBG%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, "Many people focus on how others feel about them rather than the messages they are sending. If you’re busy worrying about how you look instead of the words you’re saying, you will appear less confident and make more mistakes. Concentrate on yourself instead — what are you trying to say, and what makes you feel satisfied?"
