## Link Roundup

Cate had an amazing time last week at the Lead Developer in London and wrote up a trip report [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/28/trip-report-the-…d-developer-2016/)][tweet it]. It was so great to hear from so many speakers that they have been reading Technically Speaking!  

The Lead Developer last week had captioning of all talks (amazing!) and we love this post about why it's helpful by [@tosbourn](http://twitter.com/tosbourn) [[read it](http://tosbourn.com/captioning-at-conferences/)][tweet it] - not just for the hard of hearing, it's great for catching up if you missed a word.

Some fantastic tips in this post from [@DianaLRendina](http://twitter.com/DianaLRendina) [[read it](http://renovatedlearning.com/2016/03/14/create-killer-conference-proposal/)][tweet it]. Our favourite is about titles, "The title says so much about a presentation. You want something that sounds catchy and interesting, but also timeless. Avoid really current pop culture references, as they often start to sound dated by the time the conference comes around."

The start of a series of posts about becoming a speaker by [@jefBinomed](http://twitter.com/jefBinomed) [[read it](http://jef.binomed.fr/2016/03/11/2016-03-11-comment-devenir-speaker-part-1/)][tweet it]. We love the idea that feelings of "imposter syndrome" are actually a sign that you want to bring something to the audience.
