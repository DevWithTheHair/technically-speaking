## Link Roundup

One of our favorite things is to read how speakers prepare, so we loved this from [@lara_hogan](http://twitter.com/lara_hogan) on how she prepares [[read it](http://larahogan.me/blog/my-presentation-workflow-and-challenges/)][tweet it]. We love that Lara celebrates every talk with a donut - have you taken time to celebrate your public speaking achievements lately?
