# Edition 79

We are really happy to be sponsoring diversity tickets to [try!Swift NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com/)! [@NatashaTheRobot](http://twitter.com/natashatherobot) wrote about how she's been working to create a diverse conference lineup behind the scenes [[read it](https://www.natashatherobot.com/on-diversity/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40NatashaTheRobot%20https%3A//www.natashatherobot.com/on-diversity/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Key quote: "So it was very important for me to make the conference diverse. But, to be honest, I did this kind of quietly and behind the scenes. I didn’t want my personal brand to go from technical to diversity as I have witness happen to a lot of technical women in the field. try! Swift is a technical conference, not a diversity one."

The takeaway we hope decision makers listen to, though, is this one:

*"In a lot of companies, employees from underrepresented groups are actively asked to go to diversity events (just think of how much your company spends on the Grace Hopper Conference) and to take on that extra shift to promote diversity, but they are almost never actively asked to attend technical conference that will more than likely advance their careers. If this is the case in your company, consider making a difference.*

*Send every engineer you send to Grace Hopper to at least one technical conference this year.*

*Oh yeah, and if they are speaking at a conference, support them. I was super lucky with the support I received at Capital One. Now that I’m organizing my own conference, I have learned the hard way that really big companies that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on diversity efforts and have the biggest booths at Grace Hopper Conference will not pay for their own engineers from diverse groups to travel to speak at a conference. In one case, one such engineer was not even allowed the time off to speak (even when try! Swift offered to cover travel expenses)."*

Meanwhile, we'd like to encourage you to join us supporting this effort and supporting diversity tickets at try!Swift or try!Swift in general. The application for diversity tickets is open [[apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KurN2lTr_7aZBHKvsrdlH6gB8bieyca7Z_g5qgrLJBg/viewform?c=0&w=1)].

This week we have speaker preparation, and giving a great conference talk, improv exercises, and a great book review! For conference organizers we have what speakers want and the grey area of CoC problems.

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colombia and Colorado - we are both "home". 

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**  

Our upcoming talks: We are both speaking at [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com) in Chicago next week! Chiu-Ki is running [360|AnDev in Denver, July 28-29](http://360andev.com/). Cate is co-mc at [try!Swift NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com/) in September.

## Link Roundup

One of our favorite things is to read how speakers prepare, so we loved this from [@lara_hogan](http://twitter.com/lara_hogan) on how she prepares [[read it](http://larahogan.me/blog/my-presentation-workflow-and-challenges/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40lara_hogan%20http%3A//larahogan.me/blog/my-presentation-workflow-and-challenges/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love that Lara celebrates every talk with a donut - have you taken time to celebrate your public speaking achievements lately?

A few weeks ago we shared [@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew)'s public speaking survey, so we've been looking out for the results - and here they are [[read it](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/05/27/what-i-learned-from-posting-a-survey-of-conference-speakers/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40rachelandrew%20https%3A//rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/05/27/what-i-learned-from-posting-a-survey-of-conference-speakers/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]! Most important takeaway for conference organziers is this one: "Make sure everyone has food they can eat and safe travel to and from any events. This should be the priority long before money is spent on speaker dinners, gifts or anything else."

Google developers has a video series on Public Speaking Pro Tips, featuring improv exercises from [Speechless](http://speechlesslive.com), the improv show [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFbmJSyuKk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb&index=1)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20Speaking%20Pro%20Tips%20%28From%20Presenter%20to%20Performer%29%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrkFbmJSyuKk%26list%3DPLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb%26index%3D1%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lots of fun things to try!

As an organizer, what do you do about those grey area reports where it *might* just be a misunderstanding... but then again it might not? This incredibly useful article by [@szvan](http://twitter.com/szvan) offers a straightforward script [[read it](http://the-orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2014/04/10/so-youve-got-yourself-a-policy-now-what/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40szvan%20http%3A//the-orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2014/04/10/so-youve-got-yourself-a-policy-now-what/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The goal is to distinguish between a likely one-off and a likely pattern of behavior.  

We love this blog post from [@b0rk](http://twitter.com/b0rk) on what goes into making a great conference talk [[read it](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/06/make-better-conference-talks/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40b0rk%20http%3A//jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/06/make-better-conference-talks/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite was the section on giving more advanced talks, and this quote, "It’s super important to be able to watch talks that are somewhat above your current level -- they tell you what other concepts exist, and what people with more expertise think is important. So, give talks aimed at a more advanced audience! Please! But where you can, give a shout out to the more novice members of your audience so that they can understand what kinds of things are ahead of them."
