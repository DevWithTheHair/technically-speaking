## Link Roundup

One of our favorite things is to read how speakers prepare, so we loved this from [@lara_hogan](http://twitter.com/lara_hogan) on how she prepares [[read it](http://larahogan.me/blog/my-presentation-workflow-and-challenges/)][tweet it]. We love that Lara celebrates every talk with a donut - have you taken time to celebrate your public speaking achievements lately?

A few weeks ago we shared [@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew)'s public speaking survey, so we've been looking out for the results - and here they are [[read it](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/05/27/what-i-learned-from-posting-a-survey-of-conference-speakers/)][tweet it]! Most important takeaway for conference organziers is this one: "Make sure everyone has food they can eat and safe travel to and from any events. This should be the priority long before money is spent on speaker dinners, gifts or anything else."

Google developers has a video series on Public Speaking Pro Tips, featuring improv exercises from [Speechless](http://speechlesslive.com), the improv show [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFbmJSyuKk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb&index=1)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Public%20Speaking%20Pro%20Tips%20%28From%20Presenter%20to%20Performer%29%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrkFbmJSyuKk%26list%3DPLOU2XLYxmsIK4_J9_QsihVB18ecHKvnyb%26index%3D1%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lots of fun things to try!

As an organizer, what do you do about those grey area reports where it *might* just be a misunderstanding... but then again it might not? This incredibly useful article by [@szvan](http://twitter.com/szvan) offers a straightforward script [[read it](http://the-orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2014/04/10/so-youve-got-yourself-a-policy-now-what/)][tweet it]. The goal is to distinguish between a likely one-off and a likely pattern of behavior.  


## Inspiration

[@brwngrldev](https://twitter.com/brwngrldev) wrote a great review for the book [Talk Like TED](http://amzn.to/1TOO0ye). We love how she illustrates her learnings with examples from her upcoming talk [[read it](http://www.adavis.info/2016/05/review-talk-like-ted.html)][tweet it]. Did you read a book about public speaking? Write a review and share with us!
