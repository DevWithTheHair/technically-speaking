# Edition 80

A few months ago we changed our flow for writing Technically Speaking. We abandoned Google Docs in favour of Markdown (you may have noticed reduced formatting issues) and created a repository on GitHub. [This repository is now open-sourced](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking). Not all back issues are in there - we're working on it. For now, if you have suggestions for articles or events we should include, you can [file an issue](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/new).

This week we have uncomfortable social situations, strategic visibility, thoughts on how people learn, and write ups from two events that are setting the standards of inclusivity.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@RESTfest](http://twitter.com/restfest), REST Fest is a community-focused unconference in the US & UK on APIs, HTTP, & hypermedia where everyone can speak, learn, and collaborate.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from NYC, where Cate will be speaking at [BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com/), and Chicago where we are both speaking at [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com).

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**  

Our upcoming talks: We are both speaking at [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com) in Chicago this week! Chiu-Ki is running [360|AnDev in Denver, July 28-29](http://360andev.com/). Cate is co-mc at [try!Swift NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com/) in September.

## Link Roundup

This post by [@infinite_math](http://twitter.com/infinite_math) on being uncomfortable social situations at conferences is a tough but necessary read [[read it](https://medium.com/@lizzerdrix/being-comfortable-enough-to-talk-15a6eb105ab9)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Being%20Comfortable%20Enough%20to%20Talk%20by%20%40infinite_math%20http%3A//bit.ly/1U3n62k%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

Cate wrote about how a certain level of visibility creates what she thinks of as "career security" [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/02/job-vs-career-stability/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Big%20Co.%20vs%20Small%20Co.%20%26%20Job%20vs.%20Career%20Stability%20by%20%40catehstn%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/02/job-vs-career-stability%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. One thing to take away, is to be strategic about the kind of visibility you *want*.

This post from [@tylerneylon](http://twitter.com/tylerneylon) about creating effective content for learning is so applicable to conference talks [[read it](https://medium.com/@tylerneylon/sharing-what-you-know-900a7ea1299f)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Sharing%20what%20you%20know%20by%20%40tylerneylon%20http%3A//bit.ly/1WKVjcB%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This quote, on your audience, captures so much, "Write for this audience: a version of you who hasn’t yet learned what you’re writing about. They’re smart, so you don’t have to write down. They’re busy, so you want to be concise. But they make mistakes and may stumble without examples, so you don’t want to overestimate how fast they can learn."

We're big fans of [@AlterConf](http://twitter.com/alterconf) and loved this write up from the latest event in San Francisco [[read it](https://recompilermag.com/2016/06/10/why-i-love-alterconf-the-san-francisco-edition/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20love%20AlterConf%3A%20the%20San%20Francisco%20edition%20by%20%40recompilermag%20https%3A//recompilermag.com/2016/06/10/why-i-love-alterconf-the-san-francisco-edition%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Likewise, we encourage you to support [@AsheDryden](http://twitter.com/ashedryden)'s amazing work with these events [[donate](http://www.alterconf.com/donate)] - we did!

Great writeup about BrooklynJS and how it became such a popular event [[read it](http://www.bkmag.com/2016/06/10/brooklyn-javascript-became-heart-boroughs-tech-scene/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20%40brooklyn_js%20Became%20the%20Heart%20of%20Brooklyn%27s%20Tech%20Scene%20http%3A//www.bkmag.com/2016/06/10/brooklyn-javascript-became-heart-boroughs-tech-scene%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love the effort for inclusivity, and the radical transparency. Cate is super excited to be speaking there this week!


## Inspiration

[TW: Rape] A well deserved Famous Speech Friday on the Eloquent Woman blog was the statement from the victim of the Stanford rapist [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/famous-speech-friday-stanford-rape.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Famous%20Speech%20Friday%3A%20Stanford%20rape%20victim%27s%20statement%20to%20her%20rapist%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/famous-speech-friday-stanford-rape.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Thanks [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) for writing it up, and for highlighting the way that it was a powerful piece for her to read out loud, the way that it was shared online, and how Ashleigh Banfield brought it back to being spoken on CNN. We're inspired by this woman's courage, and by the way an in-person-only-speech has carried so  far beyond where it was given, and had so much impact.
