## Link Roundup

This post by [@infinite_math](http://twitter.com/infinite_math) on being uncomfortable social situations at conferences is a tough but necessary read [[read it](https://medium.com/@lizzerdrix/being-comfortable-enough-to-talk-15a6eb105ab9#.benawbg5z)][tweet it].  

Cate wrote about how a certain level of visibility creates what she thinks of as "career security" [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/06/02/job-vs-career-stability/)][tweet it]. One thing to take away, is to be strategic about the kind of visibility you *want*.

This post from [@tylerneylon](http://twitter.com/tylerneylon) about creating effective content for learning is so applicable to conference talks [[read it](https://medium.com/@tylerneylon/sharing-what-you-know-900a7ea1299f#.v0s3n9kqv)][tweet it]. This quote, on your audience, captures so much, "Write for this audience: a version of you who hasn’t yet learned what you’re writing about. They’re smart, so you don’t have to write down. They’re busy, so you want to be concise. But they make mistakes and may stumble without examples, so you don’t want to overestimate how fast they can learn."

The open secret of Jacob Appelbaum is all over the internet lately, and prompted Noisebridge to release a statement [[read it](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Statement_on_Jacob_Appelbaum)][tweet it]. We are happy to see events acknowledging previous failures, because pretending that nothing ever happened when *everyone knows otherwise* is really damaging. This quote, "What we can say for sure is that Jacob's behavior, as alleged, along with many incidents we regrettably overlooked in the past now would trigger the Noisebridge Anti-Harassment Policy. We did not have a culture or structure for people to bring forward claims - we do now. Because of this Jacob is no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces.".

We're big fans of [@AlterConf](http://twitter.com/alterconf) and loved this write up from the latest event in San Francisco [[read it](https://recompilermag.com/2016/06/10/why-i-love-alterconf-the-san-francisco-edition/)][tweet it]. Likewise, we encourage you to support [@AsheDryden](http://twitter.com/ashedryden)'s amazing work with these events [[donate](http://www.alterconf.com/donate)] - we did!


## Inspiration

[TW: Rape] A well deserved Famous Speech Friday on the Eloquent Woman blog was the statment from the victim of the Stanford rapist [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/06/famous-speech-friday-stanford-rape.html)][tweet it]. Thanks [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) for writing it up, and for highlighting the way that it was a powerful piece for her to read out loud, the way that it was shared online, and how Ashleigh Banfield brought it back to being spoken on CNN. We're inspired by this woman's courage, and by the way an in-person-only-speech has carried so  far beyond where it was given, and had so much impact.
