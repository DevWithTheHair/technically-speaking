## Link Roundup

This post by [@infinite_math](http://twitter.com/infinite_math) on being uncomfortable social situations at conferences is a tough but necessary read [[read it](https://medium.com/@lizzerdrix/being-comfortable-enough-to-talk-15a6eb105ab9#.benawbg5z)][tweet it]. 



## Inspiration

[TW: Rape] A well deserved Famous Speech Friday on the Eloquent Woman blog was the statment from the victim of the Stanford rapist [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/06/famous-speech-friday-stanford-rape.html)][tweet it]. Thanks [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) for writing it up, and for highlighting the way that it was a powerful piece for her to read out loud, the way that it was shared online, and how Ashleigh Banfield brought it back to being spoken on CNN. We're inspired by this woman's courage, and by the way an in-person-only-speech has carried so  far beyond where it was given, and had so much impact.
