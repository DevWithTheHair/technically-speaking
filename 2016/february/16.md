## Link Roundup  

[@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) takes on women and humor and the myth that women can’t be funny [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/02/the-women-cant-be-funny-myth-and-power.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20'women%20can't%20be%20funny'%20myth,%20and%20the%20power%20of%20making%20people%20laugh%20-%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/02/the-women-cant-be-funny-myth-and-power.html%20/by%20%40dontgetcaught%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Most interesting is how this relates to the bind of competent or likeable - but not both.  

Some great tips from [@Jo_Miller](https://twitter.com/Jo_Miller) on how to make friends with a conference speaker (with a quote from Cate!) [[read it](http://www.beleaderly.com/6-ways-to-make-friends-with-a-conference-speaker/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=6%20Ways%20to%20Make%20Friends%20with%20a%20Conference%20Speaker%20-%20http%3A//www.beleaderly.com/6-ways-to-make-friends-with-a-conference-speaker/%20/by%20%40jo_miller%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love this tip, “If you plan to blog or live-tweet their session (which are good things to do) ask if you can get an exclusive photo or quote before the session begins. Tag them in your post and there’s a good chance they will share it with their networks.”  

[@ellenchisa ](https://twitter.com/ellenchisa)shared her strategies for making networking manageable as an introvert [[read it](https://medium.com/@ellenchisa/networking-for-introverts-926489e34d2#.rguuzafi4)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Networking%20for%20Introverts%20-%20https%3A//medium.com/%40ellenchisa/networking-for-introverts-926489e34d2%23.dgiy2abjl%20/by%20%40ellenchisa%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. If a goal like “meet three people” seems to overwhelming, set another one! Ellen’s is “one good conversation”. Love it.  

We haven’t seen many of these - [@twilio](https://twitter.com/twilio) have prepped a document to help justify a trip to [@signalconf](https://twitter.com/signalconf) [[read it](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ahoy-assets.twilio.com/Signal/2016/SIGNAL%202016%20-%20Justify%20Your%20Trip.pdf)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Making%20the%20case%20to%20go%20to%20%40signalconf%20-%20https%3A//s3.amazonaws.com/ahoy-assets.twilio.com/Signal/2016/SIGNAL%25202016%2520-%2520Justify%2520Your%2520Trip.pdfl%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. They are also doing a giving challenge! With the code TechSpeakB1G1 when you [buy a ticket](https://eegeventsite.secure.force.com/twiliosignal), you get an extra ticket to give to an underrepresented person in tech to help them attend, too.  

We are laugh-crying at the Rent-A-Minority website created by [@ArwaM](https://twitter.com/ArwaM) [[read it](http://rentaminority.com/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Rent-A-Minority%20-%20http%3A//rentaminority.com/%20/by%20%40ArwaM%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. “Rent-A-Minority is a revolutionary new service designed for those oh-shit moments where you've realized your award show, corporate brochure, conference panel is entirely composed of white men.”  

## Inspiration  

We’re always inspired by people being intentional about their speaking goals even if it’s… to not speak. So, we appreciated this by [@Dirk_Gently](https://twitter.com/Dirk_Gently)’s on why she’s not speaking in 2016 [[read it](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/2016_dancecard.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=2016%20Dancecard%20-%20https%3A//pewpewthespells.com/blog/2016_dancecard.html%20/by%20%40Dirk_Gently%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This quote is another painful reminder who gets pushed out when organizers don’t consider and work for inclusivity: “However, for the past two years I've been doing more than writing my conference talks. I have also been having to have conversations with conference and community organizers about instituting CoCs (Code of Conduct) for their events. This is honestly draining work, I (and a number of other people in the iOS community) have been holding the same conversations year after year (sometimes for the same event!). To be perfectly honest I am really tired of being the one that has to draft and edit these things for people that have a 50% chance of actually enforcing the policy when it really matters.”  

And if you’re also tired of these discussions, with conference organizers who still - *still* - don’t have a code of conduct, [@lrnrd](https://twitter.com/lrnrd) made a handy flow chart [[read it](https://twitter.com/lrnrd/status/699226663129899008)].
