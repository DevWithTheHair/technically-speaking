## Link Roundup  

It’s February now, so most New Year’s Resolutions have been abandoned and what remains are the things we might actually do. Is public speaking one of them? Take inspiration from [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught)’s write up of [@shondarhimes](https://twitter.com/shondarhimes) book “The Year of Yes” [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2015/12/is-2016-your-public-speaking-year-of.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Is%202016%20your%20public%20speaking%20%22year%20of%20yes?%22%20Advice%20from%20%40shondarhimes%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1m53tvW)] (and also read the book - it’s fantastic).  

Congratulations to [@DjangoConEurope](https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope) on achieving 54% women speakers! [[read it](https://2016.djangocon.eu/blog/article/2016-01-25-announcing-cfp-results/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Congratulations%20to%20%40DjangoConEurope%20on%20achieving%2054%25%20women%20speakers!%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1OXg92p)]. Notice how they worked at it - through outreach - and had a blind CfP review process.  

Another conference that made an effort to reflect the makeup of society in their lineup was [@aahconf](https://twitter.com/aahconf) [[read it](https://medium.com/@aboveallhuman/technology-and-innovation-in-the-service-of-humanity-c56998d70b57#.5zmmbugbh)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Technology%20and%20innovation%20in%20the%20service%20of%20humanity%20by%20%40sw%20%26%20%40bronwen%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1SQoAjW)]. Our favourite quote, “But don’t laud us for this, don’t call us trailblazers. All we’re doing is reflecting the world as it is. That anyone considers a tech conference with 50% female speakers an achievement in 2016 is ludicrous.”  

We loved this post on MC-ing a conference from [@feministy](https://twitter.com/feministy) [[read it](http://lizabinante.com/blog/being-a-conference-mc/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20different%20side%20of%20the%20mic%3A%20being%20a%20conference%20MC%20-%20http%3A//lizabinante.com/blog/being-a-conference-mc/%20/by%20%40feministy%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. She really enjoyed it but keeps it real about what it takes to MC a *four day event* (we’re amazed) and as for if she recommends it, “Only if you are a top notch, high energy, super social person who can turn it on at the drop of a hat.” Yikes!  

Inspired by walking tours in NOLA, Cate wrote up some things we can learn from them [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/02/01/presenting-lessons-from-walking-tours/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Presenting%20Lessons%20from%20Walking%20Tours%20by%20%40catehstn%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1SzZ6Wt)]. Including: give people somewhere to go when it’s over.  

## Inspiration  

What to do when the industry expert is sitting at the front row of your talk? Chiu-Ki can confirm that she has used this tactic from [@CommitStrip](https://twitter.com/CommitStrip/) with great success [[read it](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2016/01/27/true-story-when-the-maker-is-in-the-room/)] [[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=True%20story%3A%20when%20the%20maker%20is%20in%20the%20room%20by%20%40CommitStrip%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1ZZU8Tr)]!
