Excitement is building for Chiu-Ki’s first conference [@360AnDev](https://twitter.com/360AnDev)! Keynotes were announced this week, [@chethaase](https://twitter.com/chethaase), [@romainguy](https://twitter.com/romainguy) and [@KellyShuster](https://twitter.com/kellyshuster). There’s still time to [submit](http://360andev.com/call-for-papers/), and if you missed the hangout you can catch the recording [here](https://plus.google.com/events/cjmklls3l9b9d391hjj5fl3umt8).

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@selfconference](https://twitter.com/selfconference), the conference in Detroit about tech and people. Cate is speaking this year, and Technically Speaking is a sponsor [[buy your ticket](http://selfconference.org/#tickets)]!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Colombia and Colorado - we are both “home”.

## Link Roundup  

We love this collection of tips from [@brainwane](https://twitter.com/brainwane/) about improving your talk submission rate [[read it](http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2016/03/29/0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Improving%20your%20talk%20submission%20rate%20by%20%40brainwane%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1YcGLzp)]. Our favourite tip is to turn popular blog posts into talks - you’ve already proven that people are interested in what you have to say on that topic!  

We are always fascinated by people’s writing on their talk preparation process, so we appreciated this by [@thnkclrly](https://twitter.com/thnkclrly) on using Paper to create their slides [[read it](http://blog.fiftythree.com/posts/give-your-next-presentation-with-paper)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Give%20Your%20Next%20Presentation%20with%20Paper%20by%20%40thnkclrly%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/202v93C)]. Their key point on what differentiates this from other slide creation tools, “The combination of imported images, hand-drawn elements, and text is powerful enough to be truly useful, yet simple enough to make the presentation process enjoyable.”  

A common question we get from nervous-would-be-speakers, is what if an audience member asks a question that you don’t know the answer to? [@dontgetcaught](https://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) has us covered with 8 graceful ways to say “I don’t know” [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/03/publicspeaking-save-8-ways-to-say-i.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%23publicspeaking%20save%3A%208%20ways%20to%20say%20%22I%20don%27t%20know%22%20gracefully%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1RBgaLQ)]. Our favourite? “If I knew that, I'd be a billionaire”. Why? If we knew that we’d be billionaires!  

We are intrigued by the idea of a conference without conference badges [[read it](http://supportdriven.com/2016/03/31/the-problem-with-name-badges-and-lanyards/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Problem%20With%20Name%20Badges%20And%20Lanyards%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1q2jTaA)]. Firstly we love the idea that people might ask for names and remember them better! And secondly we adore the pin they designed for those who like to keep badges as keepsakes.  

The LambdaConf trashfire continues to burn, now making it into Inc [[read it](http://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/why-it-matters-that-an-obscure-programming-conference-is-hosting-mencius-moldbug.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Controversy%20Rages%20Over%20%27Pro-Slavery%27%20Tech%20Speaker%20Curtis%20Yarvin%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/23cyuPw)] and ModelViewCulture [[read it](https://modelviewculture.com/news/lambda-conf-fuckery-white-supremacy-under-the-guise-of-inclusion)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=White%20Supremacy%20Under%20the%20Guise%20of%20%22Inclusion%22%20at%20LambdaConf%20by%20%40ModelViewMedia%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//bit.ly/1Mauf2J)]. In the latest turn of events a well known misogynist troll organized a crowd-funding campaign and all we can say is that we are disappointed to live in a world where despite all the talk apparently defending structural racism is more lucrative than inclusivity. The CfP for the alternative event, [moonconf](http://moonconf.org/) (with a code of Welcoming Conduct! We love it!), is open until April 8.  

## Inspiration  

We are really inspired by the Techies portrait project [[read it](http://www.techiesproject.com)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Techies%20Project%20via%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//www.techiesproject.com)], which covers subjects who tend to be underrepresented in the greater tech narrative. Public speaking has a similar effect - putting a face to people working in tech. We hope to see speaker lineups that reflect the diversity in our community highlighted by the Techies project.
