## Link Roundup

Chiu-Ki wrote up how the 360AnDev CfP worked and in particular the efforts made for inclusivity [[read it](http://blog.sqisland.com/2016/08/360andev-cfp-process.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "We want everyone to feel welcome, and we know that the speakers will set a tone for the whole conference, so we were very careful in our CFP process."

Wow, this article from [@GeekManager](http://twitter.com/geekmanager) on submitting to [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) is incredibly helpful for would-be speakers, including guidance on what kind of topics fit in under themes, and highlighting speaker support [[read it](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/updates/the-lead-developer-cfp-guidance)][tweet it]. We wish more conferences would do this!

Great podcasting manifesto from [@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/08/podcast-manifesto/)][tweet it], most of all this, "A strong voice repels as well as attracts."

We love it when people write up bits of their journey in public speaking, so we enjoyed [@Web_Goddess](http://twitter.com/web_goddess)'s write up of her big public speaking week [[read it](http://www.web-goddess.org/archive/16389)][tweet it]! Congrats, Kris!

## Inspiration

This Famous Speech Friday by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) is everything [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/08/famous-speech-friday-hillary-clinton.html)][tweet it]. Denise takes the comment "This race must be familiar for many women: she’s overqualified for the promotion, he’s unqualified, and yet it’s still a contest.", and breaks down all the details - and how Clinton addressed them. Amazing.
