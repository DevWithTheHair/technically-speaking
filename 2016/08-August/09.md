We'll cover how to write a strong proposal and bio, and then it is action time! You'll craft your proposal and bio on the spot, receive feedback, and this submit all during the workshop.

This week we have insight into not one, but two CfP processes, preparing for a keynote, a story of a busy week in public speaking, and blending art and humanities for more compelling Computer Science.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev), the conference for tech leads. Enter their CFP to speak in [New York](https://docs.google.com/a/whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrniFlDgX8xgix2m3TnD_53n4PQvGU2DejBKGissJIJj1y7w/viewform) or [London](https://docs.google.com/a/whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBCgCmZm5yvlKGeqFo68jS2r1tGU44q5WXFhAxea3ohqxqqg/viewform) in 2017!

Denise takes the comment "This race must be familiar for many women: she’s overqualified for the promotion, he’s unqualified, and yet it’s still a contest.", and breaks down all the details - and how Clinton addressed them. Amazing.
