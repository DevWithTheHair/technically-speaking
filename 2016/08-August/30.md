## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) gets real on the limitations of inclusion [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-prostitute-factor-why-were-not.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I can tell we're not serious about including women at conferences. Not until major conferences put a stop to prostitution and escort services at their meetings, and the more frequent use of highly sexualized entertainers and "booth babes.""

[@masonleung](https://twitter.com/masonleung) gave her first conference talk at [@devopsdaysslc](https://twitter.com/devopsdaysslc). We love this quote  from her coworker [@kelleyrobinson](https://twitter.com/kelleyrobinson): "As long as your talk helps one person, even that person is yourself, it is worth it" [[read it](https://engineering.sharethrough.com/blog/2016/07/06/first-time-speaking-at-tech-conference)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=First%20Time%20Speaking%20at%20Tech%20Conference%20by%20%40masonleung%20http%3A//bit.ly/2bDaYWR%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Great podcasting manifesto from [@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/08/podcast-manifesto/)][tweet it], most of all this, "A strong voice repels as well as attracts."
