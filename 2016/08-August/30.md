## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) gets real on the limitations of inclusion [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-prostitute-factor-why-were-not.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I can tell we're not serious about including women at conferences. Not until major conferences put a stop to prostitution and escort services at their meetings, and the more frequent use of highly sexualized entertainers and "booth babes.""

[@masonleung](https://twitter.com/masonleung) gave her first conference talk at [@devopsdaysslc](https://twitter.com/devopsdaysslc). We love this quote  from her coworker [@kelleyrobinson](https://twitter.com/kelleyrobinson): "As long as your talk helps one person, even that person is yourself, it is worth it" [[read it](https://engineering.sharethrough.com/blog/2016/07/06/first-time-speaking-at-tech-conference)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=First%20Time%20Speaking%20at%20Tech%20Conference%20by%20%40masonleung%20http%3A//bit.ly/2bDaYWR%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Great podcasting manifesto from [@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/08/podcast-manifesto/)][tweet it], most of all this, "A strong voice repels as well as attracts."

You see polished speakers on stage, but do you know what actually goes behind the scene? [@lady_nerd](https://twitter.com/lady_nerd) shares the insecurities that comes with being a speaker: the slides, the demo, the talk structure, the words, the crowd. Key quotes: "They didn’t choose me for perfection", "Go show your vulnerability and change the world." [[read it](https://medium.com/defensible-me/the-girl-on-the-stage-d5749b97e8be#.i2pwwzgfb)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=For%20those%20amazing%20women%20who%20haven't%20yet%20stepped%20out%20to%20speak,%20it's%20your%20turn.%20By%20%40lady_nerd%20http%3A//bit.ly/2aJhaMu%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]
