## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) gets real on the limitations of inclusion [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-prostitute-factor-why-were-not.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "I can tell we're not serious about including women at conferences. Not until major conferences put a stop to prostitution and escort services at their meetings, and the more frequent use of highly sexualized entertainers and "booth babes.""
