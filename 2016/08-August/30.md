*From [@noopkat](https://twitter.com/noopkat): I had the opportunity to speak at the last EmpireNode. I noticed it had one of the most diverse speaker lineups compared to other NodeJS conferences being run that year. All talks were live captioned, and the emcee was fantastic at helping attendees get to know the speakers in a candid way. The organisers set a really good example for other conferences to follow. The talks touched on topics such as public data projects, NodeJS robotics, desktop applications made in NodeJS, and microservices. I felt there was a talk for everyone's interests!*

## Link Roundup

[@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) gets real on the limitations of inclusion [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-prostitute-factor-why-were-not.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20prostitute%20factor%3A%20Why%20we're%20not%20serious%20about%20women%20at%20conferences%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-prostitute-factor-why-were-not.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "I can tell we're not serious about including women at conferences. Not until major conferences put a stop to prostitution and escort services at their meetings, and the more frequent use of highly sexualized entertainers and "booth babes.""

[@masonleung](https://twitter.com/masonleung) gave her first conference talk at [@devopsdaysslc](https://twitter.com/devopsdaysslc). We love this quote  from her coworker [@kelleyrobinson](https://twitter.com/kelleyrobinson): "As long as your talk helps one person, even that person is yourself, it is worth it" [[read it](https://engineering.sharethrough.com/blog/2016/07/06/first-time-speaking-at-tech-conference)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=First%20Time%20Speaking%20at%20Tech%20Conference%20by%20%40masonleung%20http%3A//bit.ly/2bDaYWR%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Great podcasting manifesto from [@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/08/podcast-manifesto/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=11-Point%20Manifesto%20for%20Podcasting%20by%20%40gretchenrubin%20http%3A//gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/08/podcast-manifesto%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], most of all this, "A strong voice repels as well as attracts."

You see polished speakers on stage, but do you know what actually goes behind the scene? [@lady_nerd](https://twitter.com/lady_nerd) shares the insecurities that comes with being a speaker: the slides, the demo, the talk structure, the words, the crowd. Key quotes: "They didn’t choose me for perfection", "Go show your vulnerability and change the world." [[read it](https://medium.com/defensible-me/the-girl-on-the-stage-d5749b97e8be#.i2pwwzgfb)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=For%20those%20amazing%20women%20who%20haven't%20yet%20stepped%20out%20to%20speak,%20it's%20your%20turn.%20By%20%40lady_nerd%20http%3A//bit.ly/2aJhaMu%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

Insightful post from [@glenmaddern](https://twitter.com/glenmaddern) on the [@cssconfau](https://twitter.com/cssconfau) CFP process. They ask "whether the talk has been given before, gender, level of speaking experience and the length of time spent in the tech industry" to identify promising newcomers. They also use placeholders in an anonymised description field to "let a speaker explain why their talk description is interesting, without giving away who they are."

## Inspiration

We're inspired by how [@rockbot](https://twitter.com/rockbot) posts her bio on her website. She has 4 versions: Twitter Bio, Conference Bio, Generic Bio and Big Kid Bio [[read it](http://rckbt.me/about)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20the%20Twitter%20Bio,%20Conference%20Bio,%20Generic%20Bio%20%26%20Big%20Kid%20Bio%20from%20%40rockbot%20http%3A//rckbt.me/about%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Making it public means event organizers can find it the own. But if you don't want to do that, at least collect your bio in a document so you can refine and reuse them for different occasions.
