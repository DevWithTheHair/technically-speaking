# Edition ?

Oops, last week we included the View Source Seattle CfP, but sadly that event was cancelled. We also mistakenly got someone's twitter handle wrong - it's [@Geek_Manager](http://twitter.com/geek_manager) not [@GeekManager](http://twitter.com/geekmanager) who wrote the article about the Lead Dev CfP. We're sorry!

Reminder: you can sign up for our a public speaking workshop at [360|iDev](http://360idev.com/sessions/conference-proposal-writing/) in Denver on August 21 [[register](http://360idev.com/#tile_registration)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20proposal%20writing%20workshop%3A%20From%20brainstorm%20to%20submit%20at%20%40360idev%20by%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//360idev.com/%23tile_registration)]. We'll cover how to write a strong proposal and bio, and then it is action time! You'll craft your proposal and bio on the spot, receive feedback, and this submit all during the workshop.

## Link Roundup

This article by [@lady_nerd](http://twitter.com/lady_nerd) is full of wisdom about making events inclusive - and some examples of things going wrong [[read it](https://medium.com/defensible-me/creating-safe-places-59158520c5d8#.z0ubezas9)][tweet it]. Important point, "make a statement at your event so that attendees know something has happened (you don’t need to name and shame but you should say something and reiterate the code of conduct/processes for reporting)".

## Inspiration

Cate had an awesome time as an attendee at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) this year, and as a speaker last year, in part because of the amazing lineup and diversity of speakers. [@Geek_Manager](http://twitter.com/geek_manager) wrote up some of the strategies that supported this [[read it](https://medium.com/@geek_manager/broadening-the-responses-to-our-conference-cfp-a22f120fa941#.4kbjgq6ft)][tweet it]. We were happy to be part of it, and hope other conferences will be inspired by these efforts.
