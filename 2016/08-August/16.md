# Edition ?

Oops, last week we included the View Source Seattle CfP, but sadly that event was cancelled. We also mistakenly got someone's twitter handle wrong - it's [@Geek_Manager](http://twitter.com/geek_manager) not [@GeekManager](http://twitter.com/geekmanager) who wrote the article about the Lead Dev CfP. We're sorry!

Reminder: you can sign up for our a public speaking workshop at [360|iDev](http://360idev.com/sessions/conference-proposal-writing/) in Denver on August 21 [[register](http://360idev.com/#tile_registration)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20proposal%20writing%20workshop%3A%20From%20brainstorm%20to%20submit%20at%20%40360idev%20by%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//360idev.com/%23tile_registration)]. We'll cover how to write a strong proposal and bio, and then it is action time! You'll craft your proposal and bio on the spot, receive feedback, and this submit all during the workshop.

This week we have `what`

Thanks to this week's sponsor `who`

*From [@yashvprabhu](https://twitter.com/yashvprabhu): ElaConf is organized by a group of wonderful women who contribute a lot to the community and all proceeds go to [GirlDevelopIt](https://www.girldevelopit.com). The [talks last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOq0zNgycIo&list=PLB1PViL_KEtc0yNMpoKTOJnnVMv0MLIwB) touched on self-care, management, salary negotiation, public speaking, starting companies, community building and so on. It's a smaller scale conference which means you get to meet and hang out with more attendees. 95% said they'll attend again and I'm definitely one of them!*


## Link Roundup

This article by [@lady_nerd](http://twitter.com/lady_nerd) is full of wisdom about making events inclusive - and some examples of things going wrong [[read it](https://medium.com/defensible-me/creating-safe-places-59158520c5d8#.z0ubezas9)][tweet it]. Important point, "make a statement at your event so that attendees know something has happened (you don’t need to name and shame but you should say something and reiterate the code of conduct/processes for reporting)".

Chilling story of a panel where men actually *corrected* a woman on the question "what is it like to be a woman here" [[read it](https://medium.com/@kristicoulter/https-medium-com-kristicoulter-the-24-hour-woman-3425ca5be19f#.qizwmj5uz)][tweet it]. [@kricou](http://twitter.com/kricou) asks, "What’s a girl to do when a bunch of dudes have just told her, in front of an audience, that she’s wrong about what it’s like to be herself?" Unfortunately, we don't have an answer that doesn't carry the risk of jail.

Great write up of [@360AnDev](http://twitter.com/360andev) by [@TackMobile](http://twitter.com/tackmobile) [[read it](http://tackmobile.com/blog/360-An-Dev.html)][tweet it]. We love that they pulled out specific learnings out of so many sessions!

## Inspiration

Cate had an awesome time as an attendee at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) this year, and as a speaker last year, in part because of the amazing lineup and diversity of speakers. [@Geek_Manager](http://twitter.com/geek_manager) wrote up some of the strategies that supported this [[read it](https://medium.com/@geek_manager/broadening-the-responses-to-our-conference-cfp-a22f120fa941#.4kbjgq6ft)][tweet it]. We were happy to be part of it, and hope other conferences will be inspired by these efforts.
