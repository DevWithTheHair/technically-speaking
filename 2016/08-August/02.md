# Edition 87

We're really happy to be a sponsor of [Ruby Conf Colombia](http://www.rubyconf.co/), happening in Medellín September 2-3. Some amazing Technically Speaking readers are speaking (yay!) and organizing events like this in developing countries is [really hard](https://buriti.ca/how-we-re-changing-colombia-through-open-source-communities-and-why-we-need-your-help-7825a9fd020e#.9mlp5zvm7) so we are happy to be able to offer our support. Please consider [supporting this event](http://www.rubyconf.co/), or just [buying a ticket](https://ti.to/colombia-dev/rubyconf-colombia-2016) (only 95USD!) - Cate will be there!

Reminder: you can sign up for our a public speaking workshop at [360|iDev](http://360idev.com/sessions/conference-proposal-writing/) in Denver on August 21 [[register](http://360idev.com/#tile_registration)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20proposal%20writing%20workshop%3A%20From%20brainstorm%20to%20submit%20at%20%40360idev%20by%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//360idev.com/%23tile_registration)]. We'll cover how to write a strong proposal and bio, and then it is action time! You'll craft your proposal and bio on the spot, receive feedback, and this submit all during the workshop.

## Link Roundup

This is a beautiful article by [@rtraister](http://twitter.com/rtraister), tying together Hilary Clinton's nomination acceptance speech and the commencement speech she gave in 1969 [[read it](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/hillary-poised-to-make-the-impossible-possible.html)][tweet it]. Our favourite quote, "But Hillary Clinton’s speech tonight was not the precocious effort of a young person, vibrating with the desire to move forward and change the world. This was the speech of a grown woman, exquisitely aware that she now is in the position of power and leadership, her very presence on the stage tonight testament to the speed (and difficulty) with which the world has changed."

If you watched the online furore over Melania Trump's speech and didn't entirely follow it, [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) has the breakdown - and some important lessons for speakers [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/07/famous-speech-friday-melania-trumps.html)][tweet it]. Key quote, "In the end, the responsibility for a speech begins and ends with the speaker, no matter how many speechwriters you throw under the bus."

[@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) wrote about clothing options for women presenting [[read it]](http://www.heidiwaterhouse.com/2016/07/29/lady-speaker-clothes-crisis/)[tweet it]. Bonus suggestions for handling haters who want to comment on your appearance, and best tip, "You are not responsible for saving people from their lack of tact."

A great way to engage an audience is to start your talk with a story instead of launching right into your agenda. We enjoyed the examples [@kecatlin](https://twitter.com/kecatlin) shares in her answer to "How do I start off my first speech?" on Quora [[read it](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-off-with-my-first-speech/answer/Karen-Catlin)][tweet it]. 

## Inspiration

[@duretti](http://twitter.com/duretti) gave a fantastic talk at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) about getting enginners to eat their vegetables [[watch it](https://vimeo.com/172711355)][tweet it]. She also wrote it up into a blogpost - making the content more accessible [[read it](https://medium.com/@duretti/how-to-get-engineering-teams-to-eat-their-vegetables-83e0f83af71a#.7jbd8o9vy)][tweet it]. The premise of the talk is that we're more productive when we're happier and it's a great example of using data in an engaging way.
