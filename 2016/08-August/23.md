# Edition 90

Chiu-Ki and Cate gave the conference proposal writing workshop 3 times in the
past 10 days. To give you a flavor of what we covered, this week we share

## Link Roundup

The third installment of [@cattsmall](https://twitter.com/cattsmall)'s public speaking series is about idea generation. Lots of hands-on activities to try [[read it](http://cattsmall.com/advice/2016/08/11/become-public-speaker-3.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20become%20a%20public%20speaker%20in%201%20year%20%E2%80%93%20Step%203%3A%20Generate%20interesting%20topics%20by%20%40cattsmall%20http%3A//bit.ly/2byGOWK%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Now you have an idea, what next? [@storming](https://twitter.com/storming)
explains the 3 keys to get your talk accepted: Awesome bio, clear title and
solid abstract [[read it](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/3-keys-to-getting-your-talk-accepted-at-a-conference/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=3%20keys%20to%20getting%20your%20talk%20accepted%20at%20a%20conference%20by%20%40storming%20http%3A//bit.ly/2bcGop9%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

A wonderful list of DO's and DON'Ts from [@rockbot](https://twitter.com/rockbot) on crafting conference proposals [[read it](http://bit.ly/29lidV9)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Is%20Your%20Conference%20Proposal%20Good%20Enough?%20by%20%40rockbot%0Ahttp%3A//bit.ly/29lidV9%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. How long should your proposal be? Should you submit more than one proposal? Should you propose a hot topic that doesn't actually excite you?

A good proposal needs to be supported by a good bio. We shared this before, but
[@berkun](https://twitter.com/berkun) has a great article on how to write a good bio. Keep it short, write for the audience, and put the important facts first [[read it](http://scottberkun.com/2013/how-to-write-a-good-bio/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20To%20Write%20A%20Good%20Bio%20by%20%40berkun%20http%3A//scottberkun.com/2013/how-to-write-a-good-bio%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

[@supersole](https://twitter.com/supersole) made an
amazing flow chart on how to write a talk. The loops capture the iterative
process very well. Get feedback early and often, rewrite, trim, practice, and
you will arrive success with sparkles [[read it](https://soledadpenades.com/2016/08/17/how-to-write-a-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20write%20a%20talk%20by%20%40supersole%20https%3A//soledadpenades.com/2016/08/17/how-to-write-a-talk/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!
