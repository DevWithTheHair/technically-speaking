# Edition 90

`personal intro`

Chiu-Ki and Cate gave the conference proposal writing workshop 3 times in the
past 10 days. To give you a flavor of what we covered, this week we share
articles on how to generate ideas, how to craft a strong proposal, and how to
support it with a good bio. Plus an amazing flow chart to sum it all up.

## Link Roundup

The third installment of [@cattsmall](https://twitter.com/cattsmall)'s public speaking series is about idea generation. Lots of hands-on activities to try [[read it](http://cattsmall.com/advice/2016/08/11/become-public-speaker-3.html)][tweet it].

Now you have an idea, what next? [@storming](https://twitter.com/storming)
explains the 3 keys to get your talk accepted: Awesome bio, clear title and
solid abstract [[read it](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/3-keys-to-getting-your-talk-accepted-at-a-conference/)][tweet it].

A wonderful list of DO's and DON'Ts from [@rockbot](https://twitter.com/rockbot) on crafting conference proposals [[read it](http://bit.ly/29lidV9)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Is%20Your%20Conference%20Proposal%20Good%20Enough?%20by%20%40rockbot%0Ahttp%3A//bit.ly/29lidV9%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. How long should your proposal be? Should you submit more than one proposal? Should you propose a crazy hot topic that doesn't actually excite you?

A good proposal needs to be supported by a good bio. We shared this before, but
[@berkun](https://twitter.com/berkun) has a great article on how to write a good bio. Keep it short, write for the audience, and put the important facts first [[read it](http://scottberkun.com/2013/how-to-write-a-good-bio/)][tweet it].

Give your proposal and bio another round of edit with these
 easy, practical tips. Spoiler: Delete, shorten and shrink [[read it](http://bit.ly/2b2t5GB)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=5%20tips%20to%20improve%20your%20writing%20forever%20by%20%40jspector.%20Try%20them%20on%20your%20talk%20proposals!%20http%3A//bit.ly/2b2t5GB%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].


## Inspiration

[@supersole](https://twitter.com/supersole) made an
amazing flow chart on how to write a talk. The loops capture the iterative
process very well. Get feedback early and often, rewrite, trim, practice, and
you will arrive success with sparkles [[read it](https://soledadpenades.com/2016/08/17/how-to-write-a-talk/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20write%20a%20talk%20by%20%40supersole%20https%3A//soledadpenades.com/2016/08/17/how-to-write-a-talk/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!
