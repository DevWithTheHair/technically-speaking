# Edition 59

Our first issue of 2016! Let’s start with a bang and call it as we see it.  

We saw a bunch of progress to more diverse representation of women at tech conferences in 2015, but we’re still far from where we want to be. For starters, diversity is more than women! And inclusivity doesn’t end with better representation on stage. We want to see more PoC on stage, more non-binary and trans people, and more effort for inclusive *events* not just diverse *speakers*. We’ll keep pushing this - running webinars, workshops, and scaling up our mentoring (all of which is open to everyone - including white men - fear of speaking is one of life’s universals), continuing to only include events with Codes of Conduct, ensuring every week at least half our content is from women, and continuing to seek out content from other underrepresented groups.  

In 2015 we had some wins, like when [Chiu-Ki plotted to take over Droidcon NYC](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/08/droidcon-nyc-22-percent-female-speakers.html) (22% women speakers!) and some lows, like when [Cate went into hiding](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/28/on-recent-events/) after refusing to speak at an event without a code of conduct turned pretty unpleasant.  

For us in 2016 personally we will continue to insist on Codes of Conduct when we speak. We will continue to push for travel costs. We will continue to use our visibility as a force for more representation and better treatment of all underrepresented people in tech. In short we will continue kicking ass and taking names, and trust that we are on the right side of history so those who try and make us suffer for this stance will eventually become as obsolete as their opinions already are.  

This issue we’ve curated some resources that show us how far we have still to go, but that inspire us to keep going - we’ll get there. Here’s to inclusivity, on stage and off, in tech and beyond, in 2016.

## Link Roundup  

Suggesting that panels and speaker lineups have women on them doesn’t seem like it should be that contentious but the responses [@roselonghurst](https://twitter.com/roselonghurst) received to such requests were eye-opening [[read it](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/28/a-womans-place-is-in-the-audience-the-joy-of-all-male-panels)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=A%20woman%E2%80%99s%20place%20is%20in%20the%20audience%3A%20the%20joy%20of%20all-male%20panels%20-%20http%3A//www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/28/a-womans-place-is-in-the-audience-the-joy-of-all-male-panels%20/by%20%40roselonghurst%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Lowlights included: threats to withdraw services, and emails to senior men in her organization.  

As awareness of “diversity” increases, so do the requests for what we call “Token Woman” talks. [@thagomizer_rb](https://twitter.com/thagomizer_rb) wrote a post defining her boundaries - talks she will give, talks she won’t, and talks she will be selective about [[read it](http://www.thagomizer.com/blog/2015/10/18/boundaries.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Boundaries%20-%20http%3A//www.thagomizer.com/blog/2015/10/18/boundaries.html%20/by%20%40thagomizer_rb%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Whether or not you share your conclusions, we think this is a worthwhile thing to think about.  

[@jedschmidt](https://twitter.com/jedschmidt) wrote about 2 years of building BrooklynJS [[read it](https://github.com/jed/building-brooklynjs)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Building%20BrooklynJS%20-%20https%3A//github.com/jed/building-brooklynjs%20/by%20%40jedschmidt%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It’s long, but don’t miss out on the lessons at the end, including “It would have been less challenging to fill speaker slots with developers that look like me (a straight white dude), but diversity is self-sustaining: the best way to attract a wide variety of speakers and attendees was through the social proof of projecting the variety we sought.”  

Cate really enjoyed Shonda Rhimes “The Year of Yes” [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/26/book-year-of-yes-how-to-dance-it-out-stand-in-the-sun-and-be-your-own-person/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Book%3A%20The%20Year%20of%20Yes%20-%20http%3A//www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/12/26/book-year-of-yes-how-to-dance-it-out-stand-in-the-sun-and-be-your-own-person/%20/by%20%40catehstn%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)], the book documented Rhimes’ year of challenging herself to be more open and visible, and public speaking was at the core of that. The book also includes full transcripts from major talks, which we love.  

We love the idea of a “less obvious checklist” for conference organizers - the little details that are the difference between good and excellent - and [@erikpub](https://twitter.com/erikpub) put one together [[read it](https://github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Less%20Obvious%20Conference%20Checklist%20-%20https%3A//github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist%20/by%20%40erikpub%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We learned the most from the section on ticketing!  

## Inspiration  

[@bestqualitycrab](https://twitter.com/bestqualitycrab) gave a short but powerhouse of a speech calling out the “parade of patriarchs” (our new favourite phrase) with just one slide [[watch it](http://speakola.com/ideas/deb-verhoeven-has-anyone-seen-a-woman-2015)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Deb%20Verhoeven%3A%20'Has%20anyone%20seen%20a%20woman?'%20-%20http%3A//speakola.com/ideas/deb-verhoeven-has-anyone-seen-a-woman-2015%20/by%20%40bestqualitycrab%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Some zinger quotes, including “You’ve made a world, designed around ensuring your own personal comfort. But it’s not comfortable for many many other people.” “The problem isn’t how many of us there aren’t, the problem is how many of you occupy the positions that get to speak. We aren’t the problem. you are.” “I want 80% women and 20% blokes for 30 years, and then we’ll have equity!”
