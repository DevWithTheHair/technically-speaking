# Edition 84

Chiu-Ki is super excited to be running her first conference - [360|AnDev](http://360andev.com/) in Denver on July 28 to 29. It features [41% women speakers](http://360andev.com/speakers/), and provided full inclusivity scholarships to five people (thanks to Women Techmakers and Technically Speaking). There is a good mix of content, with a core track for people who are just getting started with Android, and advanced topics including Dagger, ExoPlayer, and annotations.

It would be amazing to see you there! There are some tickets still available: http://360andev.com/#tile_registration. 

It’s not all sunshine and rainbows though. When you run a conference you incur all these charges without knowing if you will have the money to pay! Chiu-Ki has found that out the hard way. Rest assured there will be a blog post about it after the conference. Until then, if you are looking to hire Android developers, this is an amazing opportunity to reach them.

## Link Roundup

If you have speaker notes for your talk, consider publishing them alongside your slides as a blog post. Here is an example from [@danielbachhuber](https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber) [[read it](http://bit.ly/29fWsXV)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20condolences,%20you're%20now%20the%20maintainer%20of%20a%20popular%20open%20source%20project%20by%20%40danielbachhuber%20http%3A//bit.ly/29fWsXV%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

[@mseckington](http://twitter.com/mseckington) gave a great talk at The Lead Developer about employee evangelism so we were happy to see she wrote it up into a blog post [[read it](http://missgeeky.com/2016/07/07/employee-evangelism-make-team-badass/)][tweet it]. Full of great ideas for helping your team share what they know!

Great article from [@nerdonica](http://twitter.com/nerdonica) about how she organizes what to learn [[read it](https://mathonsunday.github.io/blog/post/my-method/)][tweet it] - we love that there is an entire section on information for preparing talks, and of course, that we got a mention!

This article on starting a new career in your 40s is interesting on it's own account, but also contains insight into a good interview [[read it](http://www.lennyletter.com/work/a444/screw-mastery/)][tweet it] - helpful for all you podcasters out there. Our favourite quote, "In radio, information is not your goal. Someone can talk and talk and talk, but unless they talk in the right way the tape is useless to you. If they are distracted, or overly theatrical, it won't work. [...] The aim is to get them to relive all the emotions they felt at the time, which will translate in their voice. This can be achieved only if you are patient and open, and take the time to establish a real connection."

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this Famous Speech Friday on Margaret Sanger by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught), most of all this quote, "Sometimes I think we all talk too much. We read too much. We listen too much. But we act too little. We live too little."
