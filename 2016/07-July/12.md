## Link Roundup

Here is an example from [@danielbachhuber](https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber) [[read it](http://bit.ly/29fWsXV)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=My%20condolences,%20you're%20now%20the%20maintainer%20of%20a%20popular%20open%20source%20project%20by%20%40danielbachhuber%20http%3A//bit.ly/29fWsXV%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].  

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this Famous Speech Friday on Margaret Sanger by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught), most of all this quote, "Sometimes I think we all talk too much. We read too much. We listen too much. But we act too little. We live too little."
