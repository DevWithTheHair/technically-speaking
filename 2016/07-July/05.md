# Edition ?

We're really happy that we now have third sustaining sponsor for the rest of 2016 - Kickstarter! The support of our sustaining sponsors means that Technically Speaking can continue.

This week we have slide decks - what are they for, and how can they be most useful after your talk? Fonts for displaying code, and the problems of all male panels and TV.

Thanks to this week’s sponsor [@Glowforge](https://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate has been working with them for the past year and [totally loves it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/); you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/).

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Guatapé, where Cate has been exploring.  

**We’d really appreciate your support for a future edition of Technically Speaking [[more info](http://www.techspeak.email/sponsorship/)].**  

*Technically Speaking is Open Source, which means you can find everything on [Github](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/) and you can also [submit issues](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/issues/new) with CfPs and content!*  

Our upcoming talks: Chiu-Ki is running [360|AnDev in Denver, July 28-29](http://360andev.com/). Cate is co-mc at [Try!Swift NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com/) in September.

*From [@abelotti](https://twitter.com/abelotti): I had an amazing time at Buzzconf. Not only speaking to an engaging audience that asked lots of intelligent questions, but also hanging out with everyone over the weekend. The fact that Buzzconf is a festival and we get to retreat to an isolated location, making it more personable and fun. The entertainment, the bonfires, the marshmallows, the new friendships, it all comes together to make Buzzconf an unique experience.*

## Link Roundup

We're fans of men pledging to refuse to appear on all-male panels, but never considered the problem of TV until we read this article by [@ron_fournier](http://twitter.com/ron_fournier) [[read it](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/a-pledge-i-cant-keep/488627/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=In%20Support%20of%20Women%2C%20a%20Pledge%20I%20Can%27t%20Keep%20by%20%40ron_fournier%20http%3A//www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/a-pledge-i-cant-keep/488627/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We understand sometimes people have to make compromises because of professional obligations, and love the idea of calling out instances when the pledge is broken for that reason.

After reading this post on slides from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught), we are rethinking our approach to slide decks [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/6-myths-about-slides-that-are-holding.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=6%20myths%20about%20slides%20that%20are%20holding%20you%20back%20as%20a%20speaker%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/6-myths-about-slides-that-are-holding.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Designing a slide deck around a takeaway detracts from your presenation, and few people ever use it.

Pair that with this article from [@gilest](http://twitter.com/gilest), about writing up a presentation after giving it [[read it](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/10/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-talks-readable/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Doing%20the%20hard%20work%20to%20make%20talks%20readable%20by%20%40gilest%20https%3A//gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/10/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-talks-readable/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Key quote, "Slides are designed to be presented. They’re great for showing on a screen in front of an audience, but they're a poor tool for sharing long chunks of text in any other circumstances."

[@starkcoffee](http://twitter.com/starkcoffee) collected some fonts for displaying code in presentations [[read it](http://bit.ly/29lIn8J)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Font%20tips%20for%20code%20in%20presentations%20by%20%40starkcoffee%20http%3A//bit.ly/29lIn8J%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Great write up of [@WriteSpeakCode](http://twitter.com/writespeakcode) by [@sienatime](http://twitter.com/sienatime) [[read it](http://emojiparty.net/blog/posts/conf-writeup-write-speak-code-2016)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conf%20Writeup%3A%20%40WriteSpeakCode%202016%20by%20%40sienatime%20http%3A//emojiparty.net/blog/posts/conf-writeup-write-speak-code-2016%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]! We both had a great time!
