*From [@abelotti](https://twitter.com/abelotti): I had an amazing time at Buzzconf. Not only speaking to an engaging audience that asked lots of intelligent questions, but also hanging out with everyone over the weekend. The fact that Buzzconf is a festival and we get to retreat to an isolated location, making it more personable and fun. The entertainment, the bonfires, the marshmallows, the new friendships, it all comes together to make Buzzconf an unique experience.*

## Link Roundup

We're fans of men pledging to refuse to appear on all-male panels, but never considered the problem of TV until we read this article by [@ron_fournier](http://twitter.com/ron_fournier) [[read it](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/a-pledge-i-cant-keep/488627/)][tweet it]. We understand sometimes people have to make compromises because of professional obligations, and love the idea of calling out instances when the pledge is broken for that reason.

After reading this post on slides from [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught), we are rethinking our approach to slide decks [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/06/6-myths-about-slides-that-are-holding.html)][tweet it]. Designing a slide deck around a takeaway detracts from your presenation, and few people ever use it.

[@starkcoffee](http://twitter.com/starkcoffee) collected some fonts for displaying code in presentations [[read it](https://gist.github.com/starkcoffee/f822f1804852dcb39dbc1419b59cdd14)][tweet it].
