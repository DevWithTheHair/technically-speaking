# Edition 86

We are super excited to announce that we will be giving a public speaking workshop at [360|iDev](http://360idev.com/sessions/conference-proposal-writing/)!
We will give a presentation on how to write a strong proposal and bio, and then it is action time! Yup, you will craft your proposal and bio on the spot, receive feedback, and this submit all during the workshop. Come join
us in Denver on August 21 [[register](http://360idev.com/#tile_registration)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Conference%20proposal%20writing%20workshop%3A%20From%20brainstorm%20to%20submit%20at%20%40360idev%20by%20%40techspeakdigest%20http%3A//360idev.com/%23tile_registration)].

This week we look at public speaking from both sides. As a speaker, how to find places to speak? How to command the stage? As an attendee, what can you do to get the most out of a conference?

Thanks to this week's sponsor `who`

## Link Roundup

[@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall) continues her series on becoming a public speaker with advice on finding places to speak [[read it](https://medium.com/@cattsmall/how-to-become-a-public-speaker-in-1-year-step-2-locate-opportunities-408ed6aab7a1)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20to%20become%20a%20public%20speaker%20in%201%20year%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8AStep%202%3A%20Locate%20opportunities%20by%20%40cattsmall%20%20http%3A//bit.ly/2aGQD3l%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Great tip: get started with a local meetup!

Great article from [@femgineer](http://twitter.com/femgineer) on responding to criticism of a talk as "soft" [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2016/07/respond-people-perceive-work-soft/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20To%20Respond%20When%20People%20Perceive%20Your%20Work%20As%20%22Soft%22%20by%20%40femgineer%20http%3A//bit.ly/2afIAgel%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. YES YES YES to this point, "And so what if the problem you chose to tackle wasn’t one that was technical in nature or your solution isn’t technical?"

[@nmeans](https://twitter.com/nmeans) and [@saronyitbarek](@saronyitbarek) talk stagecraft and presentation techniques on the [@CodeNewbies](https://twitter.com/codenewbies) podcast. Lots of great tips including pacing, pauses, where to stand on stage, fig leaf position, directing audience attention and more [[listen](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/developing-your-tech-talk-idea)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Developing%20Your%20Tech%20Talk%20Idea%20by%20%40nmeans%20%26%20%40saronyitbarek%20on%20%40CodeNewbies%20podcast%20http%3A//bit.ly/29OuSjS%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

A slightly overwhelming list of 34 ways to get the most from a conference by [@crestodina](https://twitter.com/crestodina). As speakers we especially appreciate the tip to sit in the front row [[read it](http://bit.ly/2a5THG6)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=34%20Ways%20to%20Get%20The%20Most%20From%20a%20Conference%20by%20%40crestodina%20http%3A//bit.ly/2a5THG6%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We agree with [@corey_latislaw](http://twitter.com/corey_latislaw) - live tweeting is a great way to connect with people and share an event [[read it](http://coreylatislaw.com/4-secrets-of-live-tweeting/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=4%20Secrets%20of%20Live%20Tweeting%20by%20%40corey_latislaw%20%20http%3A//coreylatislaw.com/4-secrets-of-live-tweeting%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

We're inspired by [@supersole](http://twitter.com/supersole) to say no to "token women" talks [[read it](https://soledadpenades.com/2016/07/20/why-i-wont-talk-about-being-a-woman-in-tech-and-neither-should-you/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20won't%20talk%20about%20being%20a%20woman%20in%20tech%20%28and%20neither%20should%20you%29%20by%20%40supersole%20http%3A//bit.ly/2a7He8Y%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], and we hope this article will inspire others to be more mindful about asking women to give them.
