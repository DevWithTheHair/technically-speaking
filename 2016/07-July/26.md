## Link Roundup

[@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall) continues her series on becoming a public speaker with advice on finding places to speak [[read it](https://medium.com/@cattsmall/how-to-become-a-public-speaker-in-1-year-step-2-locate-opportunities-408ed6aab7a1#.7d6f8rtpq)][tweet it]. Great tip: get started with a local meetup!

Great article from [@femgineer](http://twitter.com/femgineer) on responding to criticism of a talk as "soft" [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2016/07/respond-people-perceive-work-soft/)][tweet it]. YES YES YES to this point, "And so what if the problem you chose to tackle wasn’t one that was technical in nature or your solution isn’t technical?"

We agree with [@corey_latislaw](http://twitter.com/corey_latislaw) - live tweeting is a great way to connect with people and share an event [[read it](http://coreylatislaw.com/4-secrets-of-live-tweeting/)][tweet it].

## Inspiration

We're inspired by [@supersole](http://twitter.com/supersole) to say no to "token women" talks [[read it](https://soledadpenades.com/2016/07/20/why-i-wont-talk-about-being-a-woman-in-tech-and-neither-should-you/)][tweet it], and we hope this article will inspire others to be more mindful about asking women to give them.
