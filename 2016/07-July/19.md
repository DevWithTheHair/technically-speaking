## Link Roundup

Great article by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on creating a talk that fits you like a glove [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/06/your-signature-talk-create-talk-or.html)][tweet it]. Our favourite tip? "Tell a personal story: Hands down, personal stories are the easiest way to make a speech or presentation your own. Think about how to work your story into the open *and* the close of your presentation, perhaps by not telling it all the way through at first, and completing it later to make your point." Denise is running a workshop in Edinburgh in October, *Add Meaning with Metaphor* [[more info](http://www.europeanspeechwriters.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DeniseTraining.pdf)].
