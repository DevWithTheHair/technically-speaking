## Link Roundup

Great article by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on creating a talk that fits you like a glove [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/your-signature-talk-create-talk-or.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Your%20signature%20talk%3A%20Create%20a%20talk%20or%20presentation%20that%20fits%20you%20like%20a%20glove%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/06/your-signature-talk-create-talk-or.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite tip? "Tell a personal story: Hands down, personal stories are the easiest way to make a speech or presentation your own. Think about how to work your story into the open *and* the close of your presentation, perhaps by not telling it all the way through at first, and completing it later to make your point." Denise is running a workshop in Edinburgh in October, *Add Meaning with Metaphor* [[more info](http://www.europeanspeechwriters.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DeniseTraining.pdf)].

We appreciated this post from [@femgineer](http://twitter.com/femgineer) on carving out time for growth work [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2016/07/growth-work-really-looks-like/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20Growth%20Work%20Really%20Looks%20Like%20by%20%40femgineer%20http%3A//femgineer.com/2016/07/growth-work-really-looks-like/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Some great reasons and examples of why public speaking can help you grow your career!

[@gretchenrubin](http://twitter.com/gretchenrubin) wrote about why she loves attending conferences [[read it](http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2016/07/podcast-conference-award/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Do%20You%20Love%20a%20Conference%20as%20Much%20as%20I%20Do?%20Plus,%20We%20Won%20an%20Award!%20by%20%40gretchenrubin%20http%3A//bit.ly/2a8EY0t%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite quote, "A conference is a time both to deepen relationships and broaden relationships. I saw familiar faces in a new context; I met new people with whom I share an important interest."

[@rachelandrew](http://twitter.com/rachelandrew) wrote up how she stays productive on the road [[read it](http://alistapart.com/article/the-itinerant-geek)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Itinerant%20Geek%20by%20%40rachelandrew%20http%3A//bit.ly/2a1SRhr%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We love the tip of marking what work can be done offline!

Brilliant piece from [@thursdayb](http://twitter.com/thursdayb) asks an important question, "So why is it so hard to get sponsors for things that make diverse conference attendance easier, even for relatively inexpensive additions like providing ASL interpreters?" [[read it](http://bit.ly/29MJD2U)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Put%20Your%20Damn%20Money%20Where%20Your%20Mouth%20Is%20by%20%40thursdayb%20http%3A//bit.ly/29MJD2U%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)], also check out the thorough list of requirements for an inclusive event.
