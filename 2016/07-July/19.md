*from [@wiredferret](https://twitter.com/wiredferret): The Lead Developer is an amazingly well-run conference that has a great mixture of technical and people-oriented talks. I especially appreciated talks about how to motivate and maintain connection with remote workers, and the talk on imposter syndrome and how it works. My favorite, though, was [@nmeans](https://twitter.com/nmeans) "How to Crash a Plane" talk. That one was riveting.*

*As a speaker, I never had to spend time or energy on logistics -- TLD took care of everything for me, from making sure I was met at the airport to helping me organize my tourist add-on to London. The communication with the organizers was consistent, upbeat, and supportive. Something about the organization made it really easy to bond as a speaker cohort -- we had dinner together the night before, and then we all had reserved seats to sit together while listening to each other, as well as a well-stocked green room to recharge in. I would drop everything to work with Meri, Ruth, and Megan again. In fact, I'm already working on my next CFP.*


## Link Roundup

Great article by [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) on creating a talk that fits you like a glove [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com.co/2016/06/your-signature-talk-create-talk-or.html)][tweet it]. Our favourite tip? "Tell a personal story: Hands down, personal stories are the easiest way to make a speech or presentation your own. Think about how to work your story into the open *and* the close of your presentation, perhaps by not telling it all the way through at first, and completing it later to make your point." Denise is running a workshop in Edinburgh in October, *Add Meaning with Metaphor* [[more info](http://www.europeanspeechwriters.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DeniseTraining.pdf)].

We appreciated this post from [@femgineer](http://twitter.com/femgineer) on carving out time for growth work [[read it](http://femgineer.com/2016/07/growth-work-really-looks-like/)][tweet it]. Some great reasons and examples of why public speaking can help you grow your career!
