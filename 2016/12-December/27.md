# Edition 108

WELCOME to the last Technically Speaking of 2016! It's hard not to be despondent about the future right now, but this issue is a reminder what it is to be FIERCE. Whatever 2017 brings, we saw many of y'all on stage this year kicking ass and taking names, and it was amazing. Thank you for reading, and thank you for taking the time to share *your* story with the community.

One of our favourite talks this was was from our special guest co-curator this week, [@duretti](http://twitter.com/duretti). Duretti gave an amazing talk at [@TheLeadDev](http://twitter.com/theleaddev) about getting engineers to eat their vegetables [[watch it](https://vimeo.com/172711355)], she is an engineer at [@SlackHQ](http://twitter.com/slackhq) and an all round amazing person. In her own words:

_Duretti Hirpa is a senior backend engineer at Slack. In her spare time, she thinks wistfully of bringing back her podcast, [snackoverflow](http://snackoverflow.fm/), which is a b(i|y)te sized show about snacks and computers._

## Link Roundup

[@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall) published the final part of her public speaking series [[read it](http://cattsmall.com/advice/2016/12/19/become-public-speaker-10.html)][tweet it]. It is... practise! We couldn't agree more.

This piece by [@Stubbornella](http://twitter.com/Stubbornella) about feeling infinite before having children is beautiful, and what it means to be finite and discerning when you have limited time [[read it](https://medium.com/@stubbornella/product-management-being-finite-d444e762b8c8)][tweet it]. We love this quote, "Because I no longer have the illusion of being infinite, I have learned the art of prioritization. Not all tasks are equal. Some can be dropped or postponed, others must be done right now. Some are important to the business, others to developer happiness. Some are high level and others are all about the nitty gritty."

Maybe you'll want to look for a new job in 2017. Job hunting is a stressful enterprise, and any scrap of organization and ingenuity can help. [@skullface](http://twitter.com/skullface) put together a helpful guide on using Trello to stay organized [[read it](http://jessicapaoli.com/2016/organize-your-job-hunt-to-avoid-overwhelm-with-trello)][tweet it]. A similar strategy can also be useful to keep track of all those CfPs...

[@anjuan](http://twitter.com/anjuan) has a great thread on the fallacy of "lowering the bar" when it comes to diversity and inclusion in tech [[read it](https://twitter.com/anjuan/status/808420142778646528)]. He makes an important point, "You don’t have to protect your company from diversity and inclusion efforts. But, you should protect your customers from those who fight it."

We love that [@brwngrldev](http://twitter.com/brwngrldev) wrote up everything she's learned about public speaking [[read it](http://www.adavis.info/2016/12/conference-speaking-one-year-later.html)][tweet it]. We love the thoughtful way that she shares code - progressively revealing the code over a few slides, lowering the opacity of the previous code as she advances.

## Inspiration

2016 has been, for many, a bumpy, trash fire of a year. State-side, it culiminated in an unbelievable election. This poem has been a source of comfort and a reminder to be steely and resistant in an uncertain future. [[read it](http://ecc-poetry.tumblr.com/post/153369153630/revenge)][tweet it].

>because real talk, you didn’t stop the future from coming.  
>You just delayed our coronation.  
>We have the same deviant haircuts we had yesterday;  
>we are still getting gay-married like nobody’s business  
>because it’s still nobody’s business;  
>there’s a Muslim kid in Kansas who has already written the schematic  
>for the robot that will steal your job in manufacturing,   
>and that robot? Will also be gay, so get used to it:
