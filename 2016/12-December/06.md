# Edition 105

This week we're inspired by the lady code troll, and reflecting on how far we've come - and how far we haven't - when it comes to the representation of women on stage.

## Link Roundup

[@mipsytipsy](http://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) shares how much public speaking has helped her in starting a company [[read it](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/803483096116924416)].

We love this article on creating beautiful slide decks by [@TEDTalks](http://twitter.com/TEDTalks) [[read it](http://blog.ted.com/10-tips-for-better-slide-decks/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=10%20tips%20for%20better%20slide%20decks%20%7C%20TED%20Blog%20by%20%40TEDTalks%20http%3A//blog.ted.com/10-tips-for-better-slide-decks/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We couldn't agree more with the tip to think about your slides *last*. "Think about your main message, structure its supporting points, practice it and time it—and then start thinking about your slides. The presentation needs to stand on its own; the slides are just something you layer over it to enhance the listener experience."

This post by [@agentfin](http://twitter.com/agentfin) from 2014 highlights how far we have come in terms of representation of women on stage [[read it](https://medium.com/@agentfin/-8840db605563#.tz9vtntq2)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Amplifying%20Voices%20by%20%40agentfin%20https%3A//medium.com/%40agentfin/-8840db605563%23.tz9vtntq2%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Make sure you scroll down all the way to the end for the stunning sketchnotes!

Then, illustrating how far we haven't come, Cate wrote about a conference giving away copies of Playboy - with a reminder that Codes of Conduct aren't the goal, they are the means to an end [[read it](https://cate.blog/2016/12/06/notallmen-like-playboy/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%23NotAllMen%20Like%20Playboy%20by%20%40catehstn%20https%3A//cate.blog/2016/12/06/notallmen-like-playboy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

There's been some discussion lately about "elitism" in the iOS community. [@cocoaphony](http://twitter.com/cocoaphony) wrote a thoughtful response, along with some insight into preparing a talk that people will learn from [[read it](http://robnapier.net/talking)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Talking%20and%20Teaching%20by%20%40cocoaphony%20http%3A//robnapier.net/talking%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
