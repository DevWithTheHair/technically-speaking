## Link Roundup

[@mipsytipsy](http://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) shares how much public speaking has helped her in starting a company [[read it](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/803483096116924416)].

We love this article on creating beautiful slide decks by [@TEDTalks](http://twitter.com/TEDTalks) [[read it](http://blog.ted.com/10-tips-for-better-slide-decks/)][tweet it]. We couldn't agree more with the tip to think about your slides *last*. "Think about your main message, structure its supporting points, practice it and time it—and then start thinking about your slides. The presentation needs to stand on its own; the slides are just something you layer over it to enhance the listener experience."

This post by [@agentfin](http://twitter.com/agentfin) from 2014 highlights how far we have come in terms of representation of women on stage [[read it](https://medium.com/@agentfin/-8840db605563#.tz9vtntq2)][tweet it]. Make sure you scroll down all the way to the end for the stunning sketchnotes!
