# Edition 106

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@kwugirl](http://twitter.com/kwugirl). We're big fans of KWu - she is a thorough preparer after our own hearts, gives amazing talks, takes excellent notes, gives good advice, and was one of the mentors in our anniversary mentoring program last year.

Here's a little introduction from KWu herself:
*"Hello everyone! I am so tickled and honored to be guest curating on Technically Speaking after designating myself its #1 Fan for quite some time. What I love about this community is how we are committed to learning more, whether that's views from different perspectives or how to improve our own skills."*

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote about the unpredictable reward of a regular writing habit, and community work being measured in attention [[read it](https://cate.blog/2016/12/08/the-roi-of-writing/)][tweet it]. "But there’s an underlying resentment, which is this feeling that you’re not getting what you deserve. In work we measure this by job title, or by money. But in the community we measure this by attention. We measure it by twitter followers and speaking invitations. These are not good metrics."

Amy Cuddy responded to the critiques that "the power pose effect is 'not real'" noting that disagreements among scientists are a critical part of how science advances [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-overview-state-science-postural-feedback-power-posing-amy-cuddy)][tweet it]. Remember, too, that lab studies aren't focused on what strategies will work best for you in particular, so go ahead and conduct your own experiments!
