# Edition 106

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@kwugirl](http://twitter.com/kwugirl). We're big fans of KWu - she is a thorough preparer after our own hearts, gives amazing talks, takes excellent notes, gives good advice, and was one of the mentors in our anniversary mentoring program last year.

Here's a little introduction from KWu herself:
*"Hello everyone! I am so tickled and honored to be guest curating on Technically Speaking after designating myself its #1 Fan a long time ago. You could fight me for it, but you should know that currently I can deadlift over 225 pounds/102kg+ ;) What I love about this community is how we are committed to learning more, whether that's views from different perspectives or how to improve our own skills."*

This week we have separation of habits from obvious rewards, expanding on Q&As after the fact, and bringing back technology from the 80s.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@jeffwatkins](http://twitter/jeffwatkins) - we super appreciate the community support!

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Buenos Aires and Portland!

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote about the unpredictable reward of a regular writing habit, and community work being measured in attention [[read it](https://cate.blog/2016/12/08/the-roi-of-writing/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20https%3A//cate.blog/2016/12/08/the-roi-of-writing/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "But there’s an underlying resentment, which is this feeling that you’re not getting what you deserve. In work we measure this by job title, or by money. But in the community we measure this by attention. We measure it by twitter followers and speaking invitations. These are not good metrics."

[@amyjcuddy](https://twitter.com/amyjccuddy) responded to the critiques that "the power pose effect is 'not real'" noting that disagreements among scientists are a critical part of how science advances [[read it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-overview-state-science-postural-feedback-power-posing-amy-cuddy)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40amyjcuddy%20https%3A//www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-overview-state-science-postural-feedback-power-posing-amy-cuddy%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Remember, too, that lab studies aren't focused on what strategies will work best for you in particular, so go ahead and conduct your own experiments!

Discussing confidence often brings to mind [@mindykaling](https://twitter.com/mindykaling)'s essay on the subject [[read it](http://www.glamour.com/story/mindy-kaling-guide-to-killer-confidence)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40mindykaling%20http%3A//www.glamour.com/story/mindy-kaling-guide-to-killer-confidence%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We certainly believe in hard work, but it also struck us that the entire piece came about as a delayed response to a Q&A that Kaling felt she had botched. Even professional entertainers make mistakes in front of audiences, but the end of the live session isn't necessarily the end of sharing your perspective on that topic!

Of course, most of us would still like to make fewer mistakes if we can, and feedback from practice runs can be a very helpful avenue. KWu wrote up some tips for increasing the quality of the feedback you receive [[read it](http://kwugirl.blogspot.com/2016/06/getting-good-feedback-from-practice.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20http%3A//kwugirl.blogspot.com/2016/06/getting-good-feedback-from-practice.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. It may surprise you to learn that one tactic is to share with your audience which areas you *don't* want feedback on right now.

## Inspiration

For those of us that enjoy getting technology to accomplish something in the physical world, "wow such fair isle: Adventure in Electronic Knitting" by [@sailorhg](https://twitter.com/sailorhg) is delightful![[watch it](https://youtu.be/HKZ6nDEMpyc)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=%20by%20%40sailorhg%20https%3A//youtu.be/HKZ6nDEMpyc%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. KWu holds out hope that some day she'll get a hit on her saved craigslist search for one of these knitting machines.
