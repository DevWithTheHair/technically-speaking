# Edition 106

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@kwugirl](http://twitter.com/kwugirl). We're big fans of KWu - she is a thorough preparer after our own hearts, gives amazing talks, takes excellent notes, gives good advice, and was one of the mentors in our anniversary mentoring program last year.

[KWu in her own words]

## Link Roundup

[@jonskeet](http://twitter.com/jonskeet) writes publicly about how he's trying to improve speaker diversity - as a white man [[read it](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2016/12/10/diversity-and-speaking-engagements/)][tweet it]. We're always happy to see people - particularly men - encouraging conference organizers to adopt standard practises such as codes of conducts, and increase speaker outreach.
