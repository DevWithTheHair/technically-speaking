# Edition 106

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@kwugirl](http://twitter.com/kwugirl). We're big fans of KWu - she is a thorough preparer after our own hearts, gives amazing talks, takes excellent notes, gives good advice, and was one of the mentors in our anniversary mentoring program last year.

[KWu in her own words]

## Link Roundup

[@jonskeet](http://twitter.com/jonskeet) writes publicly about how he's trying to improve speaker diversity - as a white man [[read it](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2016/12/10/diversity-and-speaking-engagements/)][tweet it]. We're always happy to see people - particularly men - encouraging conference organizers to adopt standard practises such as codes of conducts, and increase speaker outreach.

Cate wrote about the unpredictable reward of a regular writing habit, and community work being measured in attention [[read it](https://cate.blog/2016/12/08/the-roi-of-writing/)][tweet it]. "But there’s an underlying resentment, which is this feeling that you’re not getting what you deserve. In work we measure this by job title, or by money. But in the community we measure this by attention. We measure it by twitter followers and speaking invitations. These are not good metrics."
