# Edition 107

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@zoonini](http://twitter.con/zoonini). Kathryn is part of [Get Speaking](https://getspeak.in/) which curates resources on public speaking.

[Kathryn Presner](https://kpresner.com/) thrives on helping people get the most out of WordPress. After a career designing and building websites for clients, she joined [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) as a Happiness Engineer in 2012. She's currently Theme Whisperer on the [Theme Team](https://themeshaper.com/), where she helps folks with customization, configuration, and troubleshooting. She enjoys spreading her passion for WordPress and encouraging new public speakers at WordCamps, Girl Geeks, Ladies Learning Code, and other grassroots events. Non-WordPress obsessions include vintage Pyrex mixing bowls and growing garlic.
