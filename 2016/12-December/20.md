# Edition 107

Chiu-Ki has gone adventuring! This week we have a special guest co-curator [@zoonini](http://twitter.con/zoonini). Kathryn is part of [Get Speaking](https://getspeak.in/) which curates resources on public speaking.

*[Kathryn Presner](https://kpresner.com/) thrives on helping people get the most out of WordPress. After a career designing and building websites for clients, she joined [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) as a Happiness Engineer in 2012. She's currently Theme Whisperer on the [Theme Team](https://themeshaper.com/), where she helps folks with customization, configuration, and troubleshooting. She enjoys spreading her passion for WordPress and encouraging new public speakers at WordCamps, Girl Geeks, Ladies Learning Code, and other grassroots events. Non-WordPress obsessions include vintage Pyrex mixing bowls and growing garlic.*

This week we have setting public speaking goals for 2017, getting to 50% women speakers, the most challenging talk format - and what you can learn from it!

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Montréal and Buenos Aires!
