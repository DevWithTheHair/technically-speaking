## Link Roundup

We love this post from [@margaretmz](http://twitter.com/margaretmz) on getting started in public speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/get-started-with-conference-speaking-940d8a9cb8ff#.kva0sekju)][tweet it]. Our favourite tip, "Pick a topic you feel passionate about and research what topics the conference might be interested in."

[@shemag8](http://twitter.com/shemag8) shared his experience giving his first conference talk [[read it](https://medium.com/@shemag8/how-i-survived-my-first-big-conference-talk-532d337d439a#.p340xglb4)][tweet it]. Most interesting is how he cut down the time from the original 50 minutes to 35.

We love hearing war stories in talks. Regale us with the epic journey of how you solved a problem, including all the twists and turns. In this article, [@transitapp](https://twitter.com/transitapp) walk us through how they built the world's prettiest auto-generated transit maps. We love how they break down the various steps and tell us the challenges along the way [[read it](https://medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20We%20Built%20the%20World's%20Prettiest%20Auto-Generated%20Transit%20Maps%20by%20%40transitapp%20https%3A//medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

We love [@juliepagano](http://twitter.com/juliepagano)'s transcript of her mid-career survival talk [[read it](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2016/10/06/mid-career-survival-talk-transcript/)][tweet it]. It's a great example of sharing content after a talk - in a way that you feel comfortable with (Julie didn't want to share the video, and redacted the transcript until she was comfortable with it being public). Also the slides are very cute!
