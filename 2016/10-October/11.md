## Link Roundup

We love this post from [@margaretmz](http://twitter.com/margaretmz) on getting started in public speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/get-started-with-conference-speaking-940d8a9cb8ff#.kva0sekju)][tweet it]. Our favourite tip, "Pick a topic you feel passionate about and research what topics the conference might be interested in."

[@shemag8](http://twitter.com/shemag8) shared his experience giving his first conference talk [[read it](https://medium.com/@shemag8/how-i-survived-my-first-big-conference-talk-532d337d439a#.p340xglb4)][tweet it]. Most interesting is how he cut down the time from the original 50 minutes to 35.

Helpful two part series on childcare at conferences by [@allie_p](https://twitter.com/allie_p). Part 1 focuses on what conference organizers can consider when offering childcare [[read it](https://medium.com/leaky-abstractions/conference-childcare-part-1-helpful-thoughts-for-conference-organizers-203d2b34df5b)][tweet it] and part two focuses on parents [[read it](
https://medium.com/leaky-abstractions/conference-childcare-part-2-parent-preparation-d39c0c041eec)][tweet it].

An interesting contrast and good insight into tailoring your submissions to a particular conference by [@afilina](https://twitter.com/afilina) [[read it](http://afilina.com/re-how-many-is-too-many/)][tweet it]. Key takeaway: different conferences have different preferences, so don't take any one person's word for what a broad group is looking for. HT [@kwugirl](http://twitter.com/kwugirl).

We did not expect on of the highlights from US politics last week to be a Republican strategist but then we saw this clip of [@ananavarro](http://twitter.com/ananavarro) bringing the fire [[watch it](https://twitter.com/juliamacfarlane/status/784688870726176768)]. Notice how she uses the repition of "he is not fit" to drive home her point.


## Inspiration

We love [@juliepagano](http://twitter.com/juliepagano)'s transcript of her mid-career survival talk [[read it](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2016/10/06/mid-career-survival-talk-transcript/)][tweet it]. It's a great example of sharing content after a talk - in a way that you feel comfortable with (Julie didn't want to share the video, and redacted the transcript until she was comfortable with it being public). Also the slides are very cute!
