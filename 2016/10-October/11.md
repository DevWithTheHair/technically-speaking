## Inspiration

We love [@juliepagano](http://twitter.com/juliepagano)'s transcript of her mid-career survival talk [[read it](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2016/10/06/mid-career-survival-talk-transcript/)][tweet it]. It's a great example of sharing content after a talk - in a way that you feel comfortable with (Julie didn't want to share the video, and redacted the transcript until she was comfortable with it being public). Also the slides are very cute!
