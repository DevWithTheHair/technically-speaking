Fascinating story of the first all women debate team in Rwanda [[read it](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/29/487360094/invisibilia-no-one-thought-this-all-womans-debate-team-could-crush-it)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Rwanda%20Is%20The%20No.%201%20Country%20For%20Women%20In%20Power%20But%20They%20Still%20Face%20Challenges%20In%20Daily%20Life%20http%3A//www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/29/487360094/invisibilia-no-one-thought-this-all-womans-debate-team-could-crush-it%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. In order to win a debate they had to argue a position that fundamentally challenged what they were doing... but they used it to build their confidence and that of other women.

You submit your talk to a bunch of places and then it gets into... more of them than you expected. Initially you're flattered, but after giving the talk a few times you're bored of it. [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) has some tips for freshening it up [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/10/what-if-speaker-is-bored-5-solutions.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20if%20the%20speaker%20is%20bored%3F%205%20solutions%20for%20your%20tired%20presentation%20by%20%40dontgetcaught%20http%3A//eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/10/what-if-speaker-is-bored-5-solutions.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Our favourite is to find a metaphor you can weave throughout your talk.

We love the template for emailing meetup organizers!

A lovely story about [@jsconfco](http://twitter.com/jsconfco) by [@kosamari](http://twitter.com/kosamari) [[read it](https://medium.com/@kosamari/well-planed-and-hard-worked-coincidence-in-colombia-7d49b67cd9b8#.bm4q7osbz)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Well%20planed%20and%20hard%20worked%20coincidence%20in%20Colombia%20by%20%40kosamari%20https%3A//medium.com/%40kosamari/well-planed-and-hard-worked-coincidence-in-colombia-7d49b67cd9b8%23.bm4q7osbz%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. She gives this advice, "if you think the community helped you in anyway, share your story. Personal anecdotes are the best to make people feel comfortable joining a community." Her post is a beautiful example of this!

[@skamille](http://twitter.com/skamille) shared a thread about what she's learned about getting paid and speaking [[read it](https://twitter.com/skamille/status/784112300621979648)], including this point: "even with travel covered, you spend money on drinks, random airport food, etc. You lose money speaking w only transit+ hotel."

## Inspiration

We love hearing war stories in talks. Regale us with the epic journey of how you solved a problem, including all the twists and turns. In this article, [@transitapp](https://twitter.com/transitapp) walk us through how they built the world's prettiest auto-generated transit maps. We love how they break down the various steps and tell us the challenges along the way [[read it](https://medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20We%20Built%20the%20World's%20Prettiest%20Auto-Generated%20Transit%20Maps%20by%20%40transitapp%20https%3A//medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
