## Link Roundup

You submit your talk to a bunch of places and then it gets into... more of them than you expected. Initially you're flattered, but after giving the talk a few times you're bored of it. [@dontgetcaught](http://twitter.com/dontgetcaught) has some tips for freshening it up [[read it](http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2016/10/what-if-speaker-is-bored-5-solutions.html)][tweet it]. Our favourite is to find a metaphor you can weave throughout your talk.

## Inspiration

We love hearing war stories in talks. Regale us with the epic journey of how you solved a problem, including all the twists and turns. In this article, [@transitapp](https://twitter.com/transitapp) walk us through how they built the world's prettiest auto-generated transit maps. We love how they break down the various steps and tell us the challenges along the way [[read it](https://medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20We%20Built%20the%20World's%20Prettiest%20Auto-Generated%20Transit%20Maps%20by%20%40transitapp%20https%3A//medium.com/transit-app/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
