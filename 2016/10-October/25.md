[@EricaJoy](http://twitter.com/ericajoy) put together this great list of questions you want to know the answer to if you are speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@ericajoy/what-to-expect-when-youre-speaking-89bc6efc1706#.p1vnxx365)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20to%20Expect%20When%20You%E2%80%99re%20Speaking%20by%20%40EricaJoy%20https%3A//medium.com/%40ericajoy/what-to-expect-when-youre-speaking-89bc6efc1706%23.p1vnxx365%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. She says, "Public speaking is hard enough. Showing up to a speaking engagement and getting blindsided by _anything_ unexpected is the worst. These questions will help both you and the event organizers prepare, so the likelihood of anyone being surprised is greatly reduced."

Great interview with [@ag_dubs](http://twitter.com/ag_dubs) on having a popular talk [[listen](http://toast.show/series1/going-viral.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Ep%203%3A%20Going%20Viral%20-%20Ashley%20Williams%20-%20http%3A//toast.show/series1/going-viral.html%20/via%20%40techspeakdigest)]

We love how [@kecatlin](https://twitter.com/kecatlin) answered this Quora question, "How do I get invited to speak at conferences?" At the very least, start telling everyone you know that you want to do more public speaking. She also provides 3 other strategic steps to take, based on her experience [[read it](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-invited-to-speak-at-conferences)].


## Inspiration

If you're feeling anxious before a talk, maybe this graph will help [[read it](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4ybkmk/heart_rate_during_conference_presentation_oc/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Too%20Many%20Requests%20https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4ybkmk/heart_rate_during_conference_presentation_oc/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We've often found that the worst part of speaking is the anticipation - so it's nice to see some data!
