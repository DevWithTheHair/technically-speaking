## Link Roundup

[@EricaJoy](http://twitter.com/ericajoy) put together this great list of questions you want to know the answer to if you are speaking [[read it](https://medium.com/@ericajoy/what-to-expect-when-youre-speaking-89bc6efc1706#.p1vnxx365)][tweet it]. She says, "Public speaking is hard enough. Showing up to a speaking engagement and getting blindsided by _anything_ unexpected is the worst. These questions will help both you and the event organizers prepare, so the likelihood of anyone being surprised is greatly reduced."
