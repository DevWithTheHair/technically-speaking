## Link Roundup

We were disgusted to hear of James Bach's behavior in starting a talk with a 10-15 minute critique (complete with slide!) of another speaker. [@ericproegler](http://twitter.com/ericproegler) wrote a reasoned and thorough post on why it's problematic [[read it](http://testingthoughts.com/ericproegler/?p=976)][tweet it], including this point, "Deciding that you are entitled to criticize someone in person, whenever you want, however you want, is bullshit. That is demanding that people absorb you being an asshole whenever you think you’re entitled – which is exactly the right word here." [@maaretp](http://twitter.com/maaretp) also shared her own account of what happened [[read it](http://visible-quality.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/slide-incident-long-version.html)][tweet it].

Lovely write up from Beyond the Code 2016 from [@kmoir](http://twitter.com/kmoir) [[read it](http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/beyond-code-2016-recap.html)][tweet it]. Sounds like another great event!

[@OssAnna16](https://twitter.com/OssAnna16) collected the questions she got when mentoring speakers into an amazing FAQ, with information on proposals, travel cost, getting feedback, slides and more [[read it](http://anna-oz.tumblr.com/post/150934823825/conference-speaking-faq)][tweet it].

Need more public speaking tips? [@GrantBaldwin](https://twitter.com/GrantBaldwin) has 100. They are geared towards motivational speakers, but most apply to giving technical talks as well. Some favorites: (9) Begin with the end in mind (24) Crowd density is a speaker's best friend (31) Stop apologizing (35) Pause (52) Make a demo video (95) Stay hydrated [[read it](http://thespeakerlab.com/100-motivational-speaker-tips/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=100%20Public%20Speaking%20Tips%20by%20%40grantbaldwin%20http%3A//thespeakerlab.com/100-motivational-speaker-tips%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

We're inspired by this explanation of the Systems We Love CfP [[read it](https://www.joyent.com/blog/submitting-to-systems-we-love)][tweet it]. In particular the ending, "Finally, don't set the bar too high for yourself: we are bound to have a complicated relationship with any system with which we spend significant time, and just because you love one aspect of a system doesn't mean that other parts don't enrage, troll or depress you! So just remember it's not Systems We Know, Systems We Invented or Systems We Worship—it's Systems We Love and we hope to see you there!"
