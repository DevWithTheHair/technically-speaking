## Link Roundup

Fascinating story of what goes into preparing for a TED talk and what it was like by [@waitbutwhy](http://twitter.com/waitbutwhy), in particular the options for level of memorization [[read it](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html)][tweet it]. We love the exploration of difficulty for the speaker versus interest for the audience.

Cate wrote about some of the reasons that she rarely speaks at women's events [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/21/the-trouble-with-womens-events/)][tweet it]. Key point: because many such events are fund-raisers, they operate under different constraints and might benefit from some more transparency.

[@beerops](http://twitter.com/beerops) wrote about what goes into preparing for a talk [[read it](https://beero.ps/2016/04/14/on-a-conference-speaking-routine/)][tweet it]. A PDF saved in Google Drive or another cloud service is a safety net that hopefully you never need... but imagine if you ever do! Getting on stage is really scary, and so being deliberate about what you need to feel as good as you can about it, and making sure that you have that is a really helpful way to calm nerves.
