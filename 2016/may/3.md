## Link Roundup

Fascinating story of what goes into preparing for a TED talk and what it was like by [@waitbutwhy](http://twitter.com/waitbutwhy), in particular the options for level of memorization [[read it](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html)][tweet it]. We love the exploration of difficulty for the speaker versus interest for the audience.

Cate wrote about some of the reasons that she rarely speaks at women's events [[read it](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/21/the-trouble-with-womens-events/)][tweet it]. Key point: because many such events are fund-raisers, they operate under different constraints and might benefit from some more transparency.
